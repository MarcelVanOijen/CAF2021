CAF2021: a dynamic model for Coffee Agroforestry Systems

QUICK START:

(1) Install R on your computer.
(2) Install RStudio on your computer.
(3) Download the CAF2021 directories to your computer.
(4a) [Mac-users] If you are using a Mac computer, continue with (5).
(4b) [Windows-users] If you are using a Windows computer, replace the included CAF2021.DLL file with a similarly named file copied from CAF2021_Win.DLL. [If you later want to revert to the Mac-version, you can restore the original CAF2021.DLL by copying from CAF2021_Mac.DLL.]
(5) Open the file "INTRODUCTION_EXAMPLES_CAF2021.R" in RStudio and execute the code examples.
OPTIONAL:
(6) Install gfortran on your computer (if you plan to make changes to the core model structure)
