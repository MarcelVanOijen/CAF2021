  abstract = {Changes in coffee economics are leading producers to reduce agrochemical use and increase the use of shade. Research is needed on how to balance the competition from shade trees with the provision of ecological services to the coffee. In 2000, long-term coffee experiments were established in Costa Rica and Nicaragua to compare coffee agroecosystem performance under full sun, legume and non-legume shade types, and intensive and moderate conventional and organic inputs. Coffee yield from intensive organic production was not significantly different from intensive conventional in Nicaragua, but in Costa Rica it was lower during three of the six harvests. Full sun coffee production over 6~years was greater than shaded coffee in Costa Rica (61.8 vs. 44.7~t~ha-1, P~=~0.0002). In Nicaragua, full sun coffee production over 5~years (32.1~t~ha-1) was equal to coffee with shade that included Tabebuia rosea (Bertol.) DC., (27\textendash 30~t~ha-1) and both were more productive (P~=~0.03) than coffee shaded with Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd. (21.6~t~ha-1). Moderate input organic production was significantly lower than other managements under all shade types, except in the presence of Erythrina poepiggina (Walp.) O.F. Cook. Inga and Erythrina had greater basal area and nutrient recycling from prunings than other shade species. Intensive organic production increased soil pH and P, and had higher K compared to moderate conventional. Although legume shade trees potentially provide ecological services to associated coffee, this depends on management of the competition from those same trees.},

  abstract = {A synthesis of a five year research program on nitrogen (N) cycling in coffee plantations in Costa Rica is presented. In the main areas where coffee is grown, full sun coffee plantations were compared with coffee agroforestry systems in order to improve N fertilization and shade management to optimize the production of coffee and associated trees while reducing nitrate (NO3 -) leaching to ground water and N2O emissions. Costa Rican coffee soils exhibited: (1) high permeability allowing large water drainage; but (2) different adsorption patterns resulting in different NO3 - dynamics. Acrisols (Ultisols, USDA classification) presented a dominance of positive charges in the subsoil which were responsible for NO3 - adsorption and mitigated NO3 - leaching and groundwater contamination. On the other hand, andisols from the Central Valley did not retain NO3 - so that NO3 - was leached to the aquifers. In a full sun coffee plantation, fertilization experiments showed that increasing the N fertilizer level from 150 to 350 kg N ha-1 yr-1 resulted in a low additional coffee production and a high potential for NO3 - water contamination. In optimum growing conditions for coffee in full sunlight and high fertilization, the inclusion of shade trees (Eucalyptus deglupta or Inga densiflora) increased N accumulation in litter and permanent biomass and slightly reduced water drainage, but also reduced coffee production by 25-33\%. In these conditions, the effect of the shade tree on NO3 - leaching varied according to coffee production. Additionally, in a highly fertilized coffee-Inga densiflora association (250 kg N ha-1 y-1), the use of 15N labelled fertilizer showed a low efficiency of N fertilizer for both coffee and tree production. In a full sun coffee plot, where N fertilizer was only provided in coffee pulp (\textquestiondown 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1), coffee production was very low (0.75 t dry matter [DM] ha-1 yr-1). Incorporating a legume tree stratum (Erythrina poeppigiana) increased berry production to 3 t DM ha-1 yr-1 without significant changes in NO3 - leaching. Compared to the highly fertilized agroforestry system (250 kg N ha-1 y-1) previously described, NO3 - leaching in this organically managed agroforestry system was reduced at least by two fold. N2O emissions were always insignificant compared to the losses though NO3 - leaching. However these emissions were increased by high inputs of mineral N fertilizer and to a lesser extent by leguminous shade trees. Coffee producers should be encouraged to adopt environmentally sound N management, reducing N inputs and refining shade management based on a combination of leguminous and timber tree species. Implementing environmentally sound practices for coffee production in Costa Rica should help preserve the ecological image of the country while generating incomes to the farmers.

  abstract = {Nitrogen fertilization is a key factor for coffee production but creates a risk of water contamination through nitrate (NO3-) leaching in heavily fertilized plantations under high rainfall. The inclusion of fast growing timber trees in these coffee plantations may increase total biomass and reduce nutrient leaching. Potential controls of N loss were measured in an unshaded coffee (Coffea arabica L.) plot and in an adjacent coffee plot shaded with the timber species Eucalyptus deglupta Blume (110treesha-1), established on an Acrisol that received 180kgNha-1 as ammonium-nitrate and 2,700mmyr-1 rainfall. Results of the one year study showed that these trees had little effect on the N budget although some N fluxes were modified. Soil N mineralization and nitrification rates in the 0\textendash 20cm soil layer were similar in both systems ({$\approx$}280kgNha-1yr-1). N export in coffee harvest (2002) was 34 and 25kgNha-1yr-1 in unshaded and shaded coffee, and N accumulation in permanent biomass and litter was 25 and 45kgNha-1yr-1, respectively. The losses in surface runoff ({$\approx$}0.8kg mineral N ha-1yr-1) and N2O emissions (1.9kgNha-1yr-1) were low in both cases. Lysimeters located at 60, 120, and 200cm depths in shaded coffee, detected average concentrations of 12.9, 6.1 and 1.2mg NO3--Nl-1, respectively. Drainage was slightly reduced in the coffee-timber plantation. NO3- leaching at 200cm depth was about 27{$\pm$}10 and 16{$\pm$}7kgNha-1yr-1 in unshaded and shaded coffee, respectively. In both plots, very low NO3- concentrations in soil solution at 200cm depth (and in groundwater) were apparently due to NO3- adsorption in the subsoil but the duration of this process is not presently known. In these conventional coffee plantations, fertilization and agroforestry practices must be refined to match plant needs and limit potential NO3- contamination of subsoil and shallow soil water.},

  abstract = {In agricultural production systems with shade trees, such as coffee, the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production intensification can be compensated for, or even outweighed, by the increase in carbon sequestration into above-ground and below-ground tree biomass. We use data from a long-term coffee agroforestry experiment in Costa Rica to evaluate the trade-offs between intensification, profitability and net greenhouse gas emissions through two scenarios. First, by assessing the GHG emissions associated with conversion from shaded to more profitable full-sun (un-shaded) systems, we calculate the break-even carbon price which would need to be paid to offset the opportunity cost of not converting. The price per tCO2e of emissions reduction required to compensate for the coffee production revenue foregone varies widely from 9.3 to 196.3 US\$ amongst different shaded systems. Second, as an alternative to intensification, production area can be extended onto currently forested land. We estimate this land-use change required to compensate for the shortfall in profitability from retaining lower intensity coffee production systems. For four of the five shade types tested, this land-use change causes additional GHG emissions {$>$}5 tCO2e ha\`A1 yr\`A1 resulting in net emissions {$>$}8 tCO2e ha\`A1 yr\`A1 for the whole system. We conclude that instead, by intensifying production, mechanisms similar to REDD that are based on reducing emissions through avoided land-use change (REAL) could play a major role in increasing the climate change mitigation success of agroforestry systems at the same time as aiding REDD through reducing pressure for further forest conversion to agriculture.},

  abstract = {Current carbon accounting methodologies often assume interactions between above-ground and belowground carbon, without considering effects of land management. We used data from two long-term coffee agroforestry experiments in Costa Rica and Nicaragua to assess the effect on total soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of (i) organic versus conventional management, (ii) higher versus moderate agronomic inputs, (iii) tree shade types. During the first nine years of coffee establishment total 0\textendash 40 cm depth SOC stocks decreased by 12.4\% in Costa Rica and 0.13\% in Nicaragua. Change in SOC differed consistently amongst soil layers: at 0\textendash 10 cm SOC stocks increased by 2.14 and 1.26 Mg C ha-1 in Costa Rica and Nicaragua respectively; however much greater reduction occurred at 20\textendash 40 cm (9.65 and 2.85 Mg C ha-1 respectively). Organic management caused a greater increase in 0\textendash 10 cm SOC but did not influence its reduction at depth. Effects of shade type were smaller, though heavily pruned legume shade trees produced a greater increase in 0\textendash 10 cm SOC than unpruned timber trees. No significant differences in SOC stocks were found between shaded and unshaded systems at any depth and SOC was poorly correlated with above-ground biomass stocks highlighting poor validity of ``expansion factors'' currently used to estimate SOC. SOC stock changes were significantly negatively correlated with initial SOC stock per plot, providing evidence that during establishment of these woody-plant-dominated agricultural systems SOC stocks tend to converge towards a new equilibrium as a function of the change in the quantity and distribution of organic inputs. Therefore it cannot be assumed that tree-based agricultural systems necessarily lead to increases in soil C stocks. While high inputs of organic fertiliser/tree pruning mulch increased surface-layer SOC stocks, this did not affect stocks in deeper soil, where decreases generally exceeded any gains in surface soil. Therefore site- and system-specific sampling is essential to draw meaningful conclusions for climate change mitigation strategies.},

We examine a long-term experiment (15 years) established in Costa Rica in 2000 and compare intensive conventional (IC) coffee production under full sun with 19 agroforestry systems combining timber and service tree species with contrasting characteristics, with conventional and organic managements of different intensities. We assessed productivity through coffee yield and coffee morphological characteristics. IC had the highest productivity but had the highest yield bienniality; in the agroforestry systems productivity was similar for moderate conventional (MC) and intensive organic (IO) treatments (yield 5.3 vs. 5.0 t ha-1 year-1). Significantly lower yields were observed under shade than full sun, but coffee morphology was similar. Low input organic production (LO) declined to zero under the shade of the non-legume timber tree Terminalia amazonia but when legume tree species were chosen (Erythrina poepiggiana, Chloroleucon eurycyclum) LO coffee yield was not significantly different than for IO. For the first 6 years, coffee yield was higher under the shade of timber trees (Chloroleucon and Terminalia), while in the subsequent 7 years, Erythrina systems were more productive; presumably this is due to lower shade covers. If IC full sun plantations are not affordable or desired in the future, organic production is an interesting alternative with similar productivity to MC management and in LO systems incorporation of legume tree species is shown to be essential.},
