  abstract = {Rannoch Moor is the largest area of unbroken (no houses, no roads) blanket bog in the United Kingdom. Blanket bogs \textendash{} as their name suggests \textendash{} blanket the ground in an extensive layer of peat. They form in regions where there is high rainfall and comparatively little evapotranspiration. These waterlogged conditions are found throughout much of the northern hemisphere, and allow blanket bogs to form from Russia to North America. Despite this, though, it is one of the rarest habitats worldwide. ``Rannoch Moor'' by Marcel van Oijen, distributed by the EGU under a Creative Commons licence. This is because there are a number of other constraints on peatland formation. Peatland only develops when the ground below is relatively impermeable. That's certainly the case for Rannoch Moor, where the bedrock is mostly Devonian granite. Many peatlands are protected under the EU Habitats Directive as they support a huge variety of plants, birds and insects and the peaty habitats here have been designated as a Special Area of Conservation. Rannoch Moor supports a number of nutrient-poor freshwater habitats and while many of these have relatively low biodiversity, several of the plants that thrive here, including floating bur-reed and the Rannoch-rush, are relatively uncommon, hence its conservation status. Floating bur-reed, Sparganium angustifolium, is one of the many uncommon species found in the mineral-poor waters of Rannoch Moor.

  abstract = {Objectives Many residents in Beijing use disposable face masks in an attempt to protect their health from high particulate matter (PM) concentrations. Retail masks may be certified to local or international standards, but their real-life performance may not confer the exposure reduction potential that is marketed. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of face masks that are commercially available in China. Methods Nine masks claiming protection against fine PM (PM2.5) were purchased from consumer outlets in Beijing. The masks' filtration efficiency was tested by drawing airborne diesel exhaust through a section of the material and measuring the PM2.5 and black carbon (BC) concentrations upstream and downstream of the filtering medium. Four masks were selected for testing on volunteers. Volunteers were exposed to diesel exhaust inside an experimental chamber while performing sedentary tasks and active tasks. BC concentrations were continuously monitored inside and outside the mask. Results The mean per cent penetration for each mask material ranged from 0.26\% to 29\%, depending on the flow rate and mask material. In the volunteer tests, the average total inward leakage (TIL) of BC ranged from 3\% to 68\% in the sedentary tests and from 7\% to 66\% in the active tests. Only one mask type tested showed an average TIL of less than 10\%, under both test conditions. Conclusions Many commercially available face masks may not provide adequate protection, primarily due to poor facial fit. Our results indicate that further attention should be given to mask design and providing evidence-based guidance to consumers.},

  abstract = {Indoor air pollution is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. Air purifiers are widely used to reduce indoor air pollutants. Ionization air purifiers are becoming increasingly popular for their low power consumption and noise, yet its health effects remain unclear. This randomized, double-blind crossover study is conducted to explore the cardiorespiratory effects of ionization air purification among 44 children in Beijing. Real or sham purification was performed in classrooms for 5 weekdays. Size-fractionated particulate matter (PM), black carbon (BC), ozone (O3), and negative air ions (NAI) were monitored, and cardiorespiratory functions were measured. Mixed-effect models were used to establish associations between exposures and health parameters. Real purification significantly decreased PM and BC, e.g. PM0.5, PM2.5, PM10 and BC were decreased by 48\%, 44\%, 34\% and 50\%, respectively. O3 levels were unchanged, while NAI was increased from 12 cm-3 to 12,997 cm-3. Real purification was associated with a 4.4\% increase in forced exhaled volume in 1 s (FEV1) and a 14.7\% decrease in fractional exhaled nitrogen oxide (FeNO). However, heart rate variability (HRV) was altered negatively. Interaction effects of NAI and PM were observed only on HRV, and alterations in HRV were greater with high NAI. Ionization air purifier could bring substantial respiratory benefits, however, the potential negative effects on HRV need further investigation.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition (\emph{N}\textsubscript{dep}) on carbon (C) sequestration in forests have often been assessed by relating differences in productivity to spatial variations of \emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} across a large geographic domain. These correlations generally suffer from covariation of other confounding variables related to climate and other growth-limiting factors, as well as large uncertainties in total (dry\&thinsp;+\&thinsp;wet) reactive nitrogen (\emph{N}\textsubscript{r}) deposition. We propose a methodology for untangling the effects of \emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} from those of meteorological variables, soil water retention capacity and stand age, using a mechanistic forest growth model in combination with eddy covariance CO\textsubscript{2} exchange fluxes from a Europe-wide network of 22 forest flux towers. Total \emph{N}\textsubscript{r} deposition rates were estimated from local measurements as far as possible. The forest data were compared with data from natural or semi-natural, non-woody vegetation sites.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The response of forest net ecosystem productivity to nitrogen deposition (dNEP / d\emph{N}\textsubscript{dep}) was estimated after accounting for the effects on gross primary productivity (GPP) of the co-correlates by means of a meta-modelling standardization procedure, which resulted in a reduction by a factor of about 2 of the uncorrected, apparent dGPP / d\emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} value. This model-enhanced analysis of the C and \emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} flux observations at the scale of the European network suggests a mean overall dNEP / d\emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} response of forest lifetime C sequestration to \emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} of the order of 40\textendash 50\&thinsp;g\&thinsp;C per g\&thinsp;N, which is slightly larger but not significantly different from the range of estimates published in the most recent reviews. Importantly, patterns of gross primary and net ecosystem productivity versus \emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} were non-linear, with no further growth responses at high \emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} levels (\emph{N}\textsubscript{dep}\&thinsp;\&gt;\&thinsp;2.5\textendash 3\&thinsp;g\&thinsp;N\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1}) but accompanied by increasingly large ecosystem N losses by leaching and gaseous emissions. The reduced increase in productivity per unit N deposited at high \emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} levels implies that the forecast increased \emph{N}\textsubscript{r} emissions and increased \emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} levels in large areas of Asia may not positively impact the continent's forest CO\textsubscript{2} sink. The large level of unexplained variability in observed carbon sequestration efficiency (CSE) across sites further adds to the uncertainty in the dC/dN response.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The impact of atmospheric reactive nitrogen (\emph{N}\textsubscript{r}) deposition on carbon (C) sequestration in soils and biomass of unfertilized, natural, semi-natural and forest ecosystems has been much debated. Many previous results of this dC/dN response were based on changes in carbon stocks from periodical soil and ecosystem inventories, associated with estimates of \emph{N}\textsubscript{r} deposition obtained from large-scale chemical transport models. This study and a companion paper (Flechard et al., 2020) strive to reduce uncertainties of N effects on C sequestration by linking multi-annual gross and net ecosystem productivity estimates from 40 eddy covariance flux towers across Europe to local measurement-based estimates of dry and wet \emph{N}\textsubscript{r} deposition from a dedicated collocated monitoring network. To identify possible ecological drivers and processes affecting the interplay between C and \emph{N}\textsubscript{r} inputs and losses, these data were also combined with in situ flux measurements of NO, N\textsubscript{2}O and CH\textsubscript{4} fluxes; soil {$<$}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M8" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"{$><$}mrow class="chem"{$><$}msubsup{$><$}mi mathvariant="normal"{$>$}NO{$<$}/mi{$><$}mn mathvariant="normal"{$>$}3{$<$}/mn{$><$}mo{$>$}-{$<$}/mo{$><$}/msubsup{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}{$<$}svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="25pt" height="16pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="8a872e45f44a0fc3c08e466e371cfb3a"{$><$}svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="bg-17-1583-2020-ie00001.svg" width="25pt" height="16pt" src="bg-17-1583-2020-ie00001.png"/{$><$}/svg:svg{$>$} leaching sampling; and results of soil incubation experiments for N and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as surveys of available data from online databases and from the literature, together with forest ecosystem (BASFOR) modelling.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Multi-year averages of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in forests ranged from -70 to 826\&thinsp;g\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} at total wet\&thinsp;+\&thinsp;dry inorganic \emph{N}\textsubscript{r} deposition rates (\emph{N}\textsubscript{dep}) of 0.3 to 4.3\&thinsp;g\&thinsp;N\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} and from -4 to 361\&thinsp;g\&thinsp;C\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} at \emph{N}\textsubscript{dep} rates of 0.1 to 3.1\&thinsp;g\&thinsp;N\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2}\&thinsp;yr\textsuperscript{-1} in short semi-natural vegetation (moorlands, wetlands and unfertilized extensively managed grasslands).

The indoor environment is of particular importance when considering the health effects associated with PM2.5 exposures because people spend the majority of their time indoors and PM2.5 exposures per unit mass emitted indoors are two to three orders of magnitude larger than exposures to outdoor emissions. Variability in indoor PM2.5 intake fraction (iFin,total), which is defined as the integrated cumulative intake of PM2.5 per unit of emission, is driven by a combination of building-specific, human-specific, and pollutant-specific factors. Due to a limited availability of data characterizing these factors, however, indoor emissions and intake of PM2.5 are not commonly considered when evaluating the environmental performance of product life cycles. With the aim of addressing this barrier, a literature review was conducted and data characterizing factors influencing iFin,total were compiled. In addition to providing data for the calculation of iFin,total in various indoor environments and for a range of geographic regions, this paper discusses remaining limitations to the incorporation of PM2.5-derived health impacts into life cycle assessments and makes recommendations regarding future research.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to present the new model BASGRA\_N, to show how it was parameterized for grass swards in Scandinavia, and to evaluate its performance in predicting above-ground biomass, crude protein, cell wall content and dry matter digestibility. The model was developed to allow simulation of: (1) the impact of N-supply on the plants and their environment, (2) the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions from grasslands, (3) the dynamics of cell-wall content and digestibility of leaves and stems, which could not be simulated with its predecessor, the BASGRA-model. To calibrate and test the model, we used field experimental data. One dataset included observations of biomass (DM) and crude protein content (CP) under different N fertilizer regimes from five sites in central and southern Sweden. The other dataset included observations of DM, and sward components as well as CP, cell wall content (NDF) and DM digestibility as affected by harvesting regime from one site in southwestern Norway. The total number of experiments was nine, of which three were used for model testing. When BASGRA\_N was run with the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) parameter vector from the Bayesian calibration for the Swedish test sites, DM and CP were both simulated to an overall Pearson correlation coefficient (Rb) of minimum 0.58, Willmott's index of agreement (d) of minimum 0.69 and normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of maximum 0.30. Corresponding metrics for Norwegian test sites were 0.93, 0.96 and 0.27 for DM and {$>$} 0.73, {$>$} 0.61, {$<$} 0.18 for DM digestibility, NDF and CP content, respectively. We conclude that BASGRA\_N can be used to simulate yield and CP responses to N with satisfactory precision, while maintaining key features from its predecessor. The results also suggest that DM digestibility and NDF can be simulated satisfactorily, which is supported by results from a recent model comparison study. Further testing of the model is needed for a few variables for which we currently do not have enough data, notably leaching and emission of N-containing compounds. Further work will include application of the model to investigate greenhouse gas mitigation options, and evaluation against independent data for the conditions for which it will be applied.},

  abstract = {Process-based models (PBM) for simulation of weather dependent grass growth can assist farmers and plant breeders in addressing the challenges of climate change by simulating alternative roads of adaptation. They can also provide management decision support under current conditions. A drawback of existing grass models is that they do not take into account the effect of winter stresses, limiting their use for full-year simulations in areas where winter survival is a key factor for yield security. Here, we present a novel full-year PBM for grassland named BASGRA. It was developed by combining the LINGRA grassland model (Van Oijen et al., 2005a) with models for cold hardening and soil physical winter processes. We present the model and show how it was parameterized for timothy (Phleum pratense L.), the most important forage grass in Scandinavia and parts of North America and Asia. Uniquely, BASGRA simulates the processes taking place in the sward during the transition from summer to winter, including growth cessation and gradual cold hardening, and functions for simulating plant injury due to low temperatures, snow and ice affecting regrowth in spring. For the calibration, we used detailed data from five different locations in Norway, covering a wide range of agroclimatic regions, day lengths (latitudes from 59\textdegree{} to 70\textdegree{} N) and soil conditions. The total dataset included 11 variables, notably above-ground dry matter, leaf area index, tiller density, content of C reserves, and frost tolerance. All data were used in the calibration. When BASGRA was run with the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) parameter vector from the single, Bayesian calibration, nearly all measured variables were simulated to an overall normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) \&lt; 0.5. For many site \texttimes{} experiment combinations, NRMSE was \&lt;0.3. The temporal dynamics were captured well for most variables, as evaluated by comparing simulated time courses versus data for the individual sites. The results may suggest that BASGRA is a reasonably robust model, allowing for simulation of growth and several important underlying processes with acceptable accuracy for a range of agroclimatic conditions. However, the robustness of the model needs to be tested further using independent data from a wide range of growing conditions. Finally we show an example of application of the model, comparing overwintering risks in two climatically different sites, and discuss future model applications. Further development work should include improved simulation of the dynamics of C reserves, and validation of winter tiller dynamics against independent data.},

  abstract = {Ruminant production systems are important producers of food, support rural communities and culture, and help to maintain a range of ecosystem services including the sequestering of carbon in grassland soils. However, these systems also contribute significantly to climate change through greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, while intensification of production has driven biodiversity and nutrient loss, and soil degradation. Modeling can offer insights into the complexity underlying the relationships between climate change, management and policy choices, food production, and the maintenance of ecosystem services. This paper 1) provides an overview of how ruminant systems modeling supports the efforts of stakeholders and policymakers to predict, mitigate and adapt to climate change and 2) provides ideas for enhancing modeling to fulfil this role. Many grassland models can predict plant growth, yield and GHG emissions from mono-specific swards, but modeling multi-species swards, grassland quality and the impact of management changes requires further development. Current livestock models provide a good basis for predicting animal production; linking these with models of animal health and disease is a priority. Farm-scale modeling provides tools for policymakers to predict the emissions of GHG and other pollutants from livestock farms, and to support the management decisions of farmers from environmental and economic standpoints. Other models focus on how policy and associated management changes affect a range of economic and environmental variables at regional, national and European scales. Models at larger scales generally utilise more empirical approaches than those applied at animal, field and farm-scales and include assumptions which may not be valid under climate change conditions. It is therefore important to continue to develop more realistic representations of processes in regional and global models, using the understanding gained from finer-scale modeling. An iterative process of model development, in which lessons learnt from mechanistic models are applied to develop `smart' empirical modeling, may overcome the trade-off between complexity and usability. Developing the modeling capacity to tackle the complex challenges related to climate change, is reliant on closer links between modelers and experimental researchers, and also requires knowledge-sharing and increasing technical compatibility across modeling disciplines. Stakeholder engagement throughout the process of model development and application is vital for the creation of relevant models, and important in reducing problems related to the interpretation of modeling outcomes. Enabling modeling to meet the demands of policymakers and other stakeholders under climate change will require collaboration within adequately-resourced, long-term inter-disciplinary research networks.},

  abstract = {During the past few years, several studies have compared the performance of crop simulation models to assess the uncertainties in model-based climate change impact assessments and other modelling studies. Many of these studies have concentrated on cereal crops, while fewer model comparisons have been conducted for grasses. We compared the predictions for timothy grass (Phleum pratense L.) yields for first and second cuts along with the dynamics of above-ground biomass for the grass simulation models BASGRA and CATIMO, and the soil-crop model STICS. The models were calibrated and evaluated using field data from seven sites across Northern Europe and Canada with different climates, soil conditions and management practices. Altogether the models were compared using data on timothy grass from 33 combinations of sites, cultivars and management regimes. Model performances with two calibration approaches, cultivar-specific and generic calibrations, were compared. All the models studied estimated the dynamics of above-ground biomass and the leaf area index satisfactorily, but tended to underestimate the first cut yield. Cultivar-specific calibration resulted in more accurate first cut yield predictions than the generic calibration achieving root mean square errors approximately one third lower for the cultivar-specific calibration. For the second cut, the difference between the calibration methods was small. The results indicate that detailed soil process descriptions improved the overall model performance and the model responses to management, such as nitrogen applications. The results also suggest that taking the genetic variability into account between cultivars of timothy grass also improves the yield estimates. Calibrations using both spring and summer growth data simultaneously revealed that processes determining the growth in these two periods require further attention in model development.},

The approach provides a general framework for combining multiple disparate data sources with a simple model. This allows us to constrain estimates of gross land-use change with reliable national-scale census data, whilst retaining the detailed information available from several other sources. Eight different data sources, with three different data structures, were combined in our posterior estimate of land use and land-use change, and other data sources could easily be added in future. The tendency for observations to underestimate gross land-use change is accounted for by allowing for a skewed distribution in the likelihood function. The data structure produced has high temporal and spatial resolution, and is appropriate for dynamic process-based modelling. Uncertainty is propagated appropriately into the output, so we have a full posterior distribution of output and parameters. The data are available in the widely used netCDF file format from http://eidc.ceh.ac.uk/.},

Our aim here was to address this problem, using statistical modelling and footprint analysis, applied to a case study of fluxes of sensible heat and methane in a subarctic mire. We applied a new method to infer the spatial heterogeneity in fluxes of sensible heat and methane from a subarctic ecosystem in northern Sweden, where there were clear differences in surface types within the landscape. We inferred the flux from each of these surface types, using a Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters of a hierarchical model which includes coefficients for the different surface types. The approach is based on the variation in the flux observed at a single eddy covariance tower as the footprint changes over time. The method has applications wherever spatial heterogeneity is a concern in the interpretation of eddy covariance fluxes.},

Smartphone apps, wireless devices, the downsizing of monitoring technologies, along with lower costs for such equipment makes it possible for various aspects of exposure to be measured more easily and frequently. We discuss possibilities and lay out several criteria for using smart technologies for external exposome studies. Smart technologies are evolving quickly, and while they provide great promise for advancing exposure science, many are still in developmental stages and their use in epidemiology and risk studies must be carefully considered. The most useable technologies for exposure studies at this time relate to gathering exposure-factor data, such as location and activities. Development of some environmental sensors (e.g., for some air pollutants, noise, UV) is moving towards making the use of these more reliable and accessible to research studies. The possibility of accessing such an unprecedented amount of personal data also comes with various limitations and challenges, which are discussed. The advantage of improving the collection of long term exposure factor data is that this can be combined with more ``traditional'' measurement data to model exposures to numerous environmental factors.},

For some of these microenvironments, particularly stores and restaurants, exposures to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have not been well characterized. In the Boston Exposure Assessment in Microenvironments (BEAM) study, sampling using scripted activities was conducted in stores, restaurants, and transportation in the summer of 2003 and winters of 2004 and 2005. A suite of VOCs including hydrocarbons, several chlorinated compounds, and aldehydes was analyzed. Nine store types were sampled using a composite design to enable a greater number of stores to be visited. Stores had higher concentrations of formaldehyde, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, and styrene than other microenvironments, particularly in certain store types. Geometric mean formaldehyde levels were highest in the housewares stores, at 53 {$\mu$}g/m3 (95\% CI = 43, 66). Geometric mean toluene levels were highest in multipurpose stores, at 76 {$\mu$}g/m3 (95\% CI = 50, 118). The levels observed in stores were several times higher than levels found in transportation microenvironments, and indicate strong indoor sources. In contrast, benzene did not have significantly higher levels in stores than typically found outdoors. Concentrations of formaldehyde and benzene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, and styrene were strongly influenced by the presence of smoking in the dining microenvironment. Chloroform levels were higher in restaurants than in other microenvironments, with a geometric mean of 1.1 {$\mu$}g/m3 (95\% CI = 0.7, 1.8). The VOC concentrations found in stores and restaurants in this study are a potentially important source of exposure for sensitive individuals or people who work in these microenvironments.},

  abstract = {Criteria and indicators (C \& I) to evaluate the sustainability of forest management have been proposed by the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe. Although primarily defined at the national scale, these C \& I also have implications at scales ranging from forest stands to the forest management unit. In this paper, we review existing forest growth and ecosystem models from the point of view of applicability to prediction of indicators of sustainable management, focusing on stand scale models and management. To do this, we first present a conceptual framework for understanding the role of models in assessing forest management at the stand level in the context of sustainability criteria and indicators. We classify the criteria into those predictable using models operating at the stand scale, and those derivable either through scaling up or as solutions of a multi-objective management optimisation problem. We conclude that to date, no comprehensive models exist that could be used to predict all the indicators simultaneously. The most promising approach seems to be a modular system where different models are combined and run simultaneously, with shared inputs and well defined mutual links. More modelling efforts are needed especially regarding the state of the soil, including carbon, nitrogen and water balances and physical effects. Models also need development in their ability to deal with heterogeneous stand structures and with non-woody forest products such as berries, mushrooms or cork. The outputs of the models need to be developed in a direction where they can be interpreted in terms of the recreational or biodiversity value of the forest. Data requirements are most pronounced on the same issues as the gaps in model availability. It would be important to consider amending the national forest inventories and other similar standard data collection protocols with variables required for sustainability assessment. Importantly, combining different models in a modular system and with variable data sources requires advanced model parameterisation and evaluation methods and assessment of parameter and model uncertainty. The probabilistic, Bayesian approaches hold a lot of promise in this respect. Predictions using several different models or model systems, with systematic analysis of e.g. inter-model variability, could also be considered.},

  abstract = {Background/Aim The exposome includes urban greenspace, which may affect health via a complex set of pathways, including reducing exposure to particulate matter (PM) and noise. We assessed these pathways using indoor exposure monitoring data from the HEALS study in four European urban areas (Edinburgh, UK; Utrecht, Netherlands; Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece). Methods We quantified three metrics of residential greenspace at 50 m and 100 m buffers: Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), annual tree cover density, and surrounding green land use. NDVI values were generated for both summer and the season during which the monitoring took place. Indoor PM2.5 and noise levels were measured by Dylos and Netatmo sensors, respectively, and subjective noise annoyance was collected by questionnaire on an 11-point scale. We used random-effects generalised least squares regression models to assess associations between greenspace and indoor PM2.5 and noise, and an ordinal logistic regression to model the relationship between greenspace and road noise annoyance. Results We identified a significant inverse relationship between summer NDVI and indoor PM2.5 (-1.27 {$\mu$}g/m3 per 0.1 unit increase [95\% CI -2.38 to -0.15]) using a 100 m residential buffer. Reduced (i.e., {$<$}1.0) odds ratios (OR) of road noise annoyance were associated with increasing summer (OR = 0.55 [0.31 to 0.98]) and season-specific (OR = 0.55 [0.32 to 0.94]) NDVI levels, and tree cover density (OR = 0.54 [0.31 to 0.93] per 10 percentage point increase), also at a 100 m buffer. In contrast to these findings, we did not identify any significant associations between greenspace and indoor noise in fully adjusted models. Conclusions We identified reduced indoor levels of PM2.5 and noise annoyance, but not overall noise, with increasing outdoor levels of certain greenspace indicators. To corroborate our findings, future research should examine the effect of enhanced temporal resolution of greenspace metrics during different seasons, characterise the configuration and composition of green areas, and explore mechanisms through mediation modelling.},

  abstract = {Tropical agroforestry systems are examples of ecological intensification. They represent a transition from short-term exploitation and destruction of tropical rain forest to sustainable land use and conservation of biodiversity (Garrity, 2004). However, such systems are complex and their production capacity has been poorly studied. Agroforestry research has focused on the incorporation of trees in agricultural cropping systems, with less attention to incorporation of crops into forest systems. There is a need for specific tools with which system productivity can be assessed and evaluated at any stage of the system during the evolution of its structure over its lifetime (several decades). Modelling the dynamics of these multi-strata and multi-species cropping systems is thus a major challenge in agronomic research. Crop models are useful as analytical and predictive tools, to test effects of structure and input changes on productivity and environmental impacts of the systems. Some agroforestry models have been developed which take into account spatial heterogeneity, in these systems (Mal\'ezieux et al, 2009). The models are often based on fundamental crop modelling concepts of resource capture and allocation under `potential growth' and `stressed' conditions. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential use of existing agroforestry models in the context of tropical agroforestry systems for purposes such as: (i) relating architectural and physiological traits of components to system-level resource capture and use for harvestable products, and thus the `strategic' choices of farmers in selecting components for the agroforestry system; (ii) exploring management options for farmers to adjust growth and performance of the components to achieve overall productivity goals; (iii) assessing `robustness' (or `vulnerability') and `resilience' of the agroforestry system under variable external (e.g. climatic) conditions.},

  abstract = {Different forage grass models are used to simulate forage yield and nutritive attributes, but these models are seldom compared, particularly those for timothy (Phleum pratense L.), a widely grown forage grass species in agricultural regions with a cold temperate climate. We compared the models BASGRA, CATIMO and STICS for their predictions of timothy crude protein (CP) concentration, neutral detergent fibre (NDF) concentration and NDF digestibility (dNDF), three important forage nutritive attributes. Data on CP and NDF concentrations, and dNDF and the associated weather and soil data for seven cultivars, taken from eight field experiments in Canada, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, were divided into calibration and validation datasets. Model parameters were estimated for each cultivar separately (cultivar-specific calibration) and for all cultivars together (generic calibration), using different methods for the three models. Normalized root mean square error (RMSE) in prediction of CP concentration varied between 16 and 26\% for BASGRA, 45 and 101\% for CATIMO and 23 and 40\% for STICS across the two calibration methods and the calibration and validation datasets. Normalised RMSE in prediction of NDF concentration varied between 8 and 13\% for BASGRA, 14 and 21\% for CATIMO and 8 and 12\% for STICS, while for dNDF it varied between 7 and 22\% for BASGRA, 7 and 38\% for CATIMO and 5 and 6\% for STICS. Cultivar-specific calibration improved the performance of CATIMO and STICS, but not BASGRA, compared with generic calibration. The prediction accuracy for NDF concentration and dNDF with the three models was within the same range or better than that for forage dry matter (DM) yield of timothy. Overall, the three models performed well in predicting some nutritive attributes and yield in Northern Europe and Canada, but improvements are required, particularly to increase the prediction accuracy of CP concentration.},

  abstract = {Due to the lack of a simulation model, predictions of climate change (CC) impact on coffee do not include CO2 fertilization; they include only changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. It is hypothesized that temperature, rainfall and CO2 will have interacting effects on coffee productivity in agroforestry systems and on the environmental services they provide to society. The aim of this presentation is to include CO2 fertilization in the predictions of CC impacts using CAF2007, a coffee simulation model developed during the EU--funded CASCA project by Van Oijen et al. The model considers, for shaded and sunlit coffee plants separately, how carbon and nitrogen content, leaf area and phenology change over time. Simulations were done for three locations at contrasted altitudes in Chiapas, Mexico. The model calculated a very significant CO2 fertilization effect on coffee bean production. Production, as calculated by the model, increased with altitude, irrespective of the climate considered. When CO2 fertilization was not considered, temperature increase and modification of rainfall pattern reduced bean production. This reduction was worse at higher than at lower altitudes. When CO2 fertilization was included, the model calculated a positive effect of CC on bean production, and this effect was higher at intermediate altitude. Simulations were made to show the possible use of CAF2007 to test shade management effects on coffee production and on environmental services provision. Management modified all performances, and these effects were modified by CC. The CAF2007 model has not been thoroughly validated so far; the results have to be considered with care, and used for discussion more than predictions of the future of coffee productivity. The model is being validated in 2009. Nevertheless, fertilization is a well known effect, and these results showed that it must be taken into account to determine possible impacts of CC on coffee.

  abstract = {The parameter uncertainty of process-based models has received little attention in climate change impact studies. This paper aims to integrate parameter uncertainty into simulations of climate change impacts on forest net primary productivity (NPP). We used either prior (uncalibrated) or posterior (calibrated using Bayesian calibration) parameter variations to express parameter uncertainty, and we assessed the effect of parameter uncertainty on projections of the process-based model 4C in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands under climate change. We compared the uncertainty induced by differences between climate models with the uncertainty induced by parameter variability and climate models together. The results show that the uncertainty of simulated changes in NPP induced by climate model and parameter uncertainty is substantially higher than the uncertainty of NPP changes induced by climate model uncertainty alone. That said, the direction of NPP change is mostly consistent between the simulations using the standard parameter setting of 4C and the majority of the simulations including parameter uncertainty. Climate change impact studies that do not consider parameter uncertainty may therefore be appropriate for projecting the direction of change, but not for quantifying the exact degree of change, especially if parameter combinations are selected that are particularly climate sensitive. We conclude that if a key objective in climate change impact research is to quantify uncertainty, parameter uncertainty as a major factor driving the degree of uncertainty of projections should be included.},

In addition to revealing the underlying simplicity of statistical methods, the book explains how to parameterise and compare models while accounting for uncertainties in data, model parameters and model structures. How exactly should data be used in modelling? The literature offers a bewildering variety of techniques and approaches (Bayesian calibration, data assimilation, Kalman filtering, model-data fusion, etc). This book provides a short and easy guide to all of these and more. It was written from a unifying Bayesian perspective, which reveals how the multitude of techniques and approaches are in fact all related to one another. Basic notions from probability theory are introduced. Executable code examples are included to enhance the book's practical use for scientific modellers, and all code is available online as well.},

The models tend to have a large number of parameters that represent properties of the plants. To simulate different cultivars of the same species, different parameter values are required. Parameter differences may be interpreted as genetic variation for plant traits. Despite this natural connection between PBMs and plant genetics, there are only few examples of successful use of PBMs in plant breeding. Here we present a new procedure by which PBMs can help design ideotypes, i.e. virtual cultivars that optimally combine properties of existing cultivars. Ideotypes constitute selection targets for breeding. The procedure consists of four steps: (1) Bayesian calibration of model parameters using data from cultivar trials, (2) Estimating genetic variation for parameters from the combination of cultivar-specific calibrated parameter distributions, (3) Identifying parameter combinations that meet breeding objectives, (4) Translating model results to practice, i.e. interpreting parameters in terms of practical selection criteria. We show an application of the procedure to timothy (Phleum pratense L.) as grown in different regions of Norway.},

A high level of biodiversity may confer stability to grassland ecosystems against environmental change, but there are also direct effects of biodiversity on the quantity and quality of grassland productivity. To explain the manifold interactions, and to predict future climatic responses, models may be used. However, models designed for studying the interaction between biodiversity and productivity tend to be structurally different from models for studying the effects of climatic impacts. Here we review the literature on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and productivity of grasslands. We first discuss the availability of data for model development. Then we analyse strengths and weaknesses of three types of model: ecological, process-based and integrated. We discuss the merits of this model diversity and the scope for merging different model types.},

The model was validated by accurately simulating a field experiment conducted in another year. Sensitivity analysis with the model showed that late cultivars are longer able to maintain a green canopy in the presence of disease, but still suffer more yield loss than early cultivars. The level of partial resistance of a cultivar was more important than its level of tolerance, and other plant characteristics. The model calculations showed that only between 4 and 15\% of the yield loss in the experiments was due to accelerated leaf senescence caused by the disease; the major part of the loss was caused by lesion coverage of leaves.},

The cultivars differed more in rate of primary infection of healthy leaves than in the subsequent increase in percentage lesion coverage of the infected leaves. Differences between cultivars in stem lesion coverage resembled the differences for leaf lesions, but in every cultivar stem lesions were most prominent in the top of the canopy, contrary to leaf lesions.P. infestans stimulated leaf senescence similarly in the different cultivars.},

Seasonal courses of ground cover by green foliage and final tuber yields were determined. Light use efficiencies (LUE) were calculated from regression analyses of yield on cumulative light interception.Late blight reduced tuber yields by decreasing cumulative light interception without affecting LUE. No differences in LUE between cultivars or cultivar classes were detected. Therefore, the maintenance of green leaf area is important when breeding potatoes for optimal performance in the presence of late blight.The results support the hypothesis that the correlation between lateness and reported resistance of potato cultivars is due to the vigorous foliage growth of late cultivars.},

The first attempts to simulate nematode population dynamics together with host growth were done in the 1970s. For many years the models focussed on the rate of growth of the nematode population, while using oversimplified, descriptive functions for host growth and its response to nematodes. Further development was hampered by lack of information on the physiological damage mechanisms involved. However, recent years have witnessed the development of sophisticated combination models that treat both pest and host in a more realistic manner. It is becoming increasingly clear that cyst nematodes affect both the carbon and nutrient metabolism of their host. Possible ways to incorporate the various damage mechanisms into simulation models are discussed.},

The models were: the logistic equation, the paralogistic or Vanderplank equation, two models from medical epidemiology with similar complexity, and a slightly more complex model with explicit treatment of lesion expansion. The use of the models for analysing the sensitivity of disease progress to changes in resistance components is discussed. Sensitivity analysis of the most complex model, by varying components within their range of genetic variation, indicates lesion expansion and infection efficiency as the components offering the best perspectives for resistance breeding. Improving two components simultaneously reduces disease progress slightly more than additively, but not enough to add other components to the list of breeding objectives. Pitfalls in using models for component sensitivity analysis, in the form of erroneous model initializations, are discussed, including implications for the role of components in the development of natural epidemics and in resistance breeding trials.},

The model includes uptake of nitrate, reduction and assimilation of nitrogen compounds in the plant and transport between different plant parts in xylem and phloem. Simulation of carbon metabolism is included because of its relationship with N metabolism. The results of the model show the growth rates for three levels of N availability.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a decline in herbage production and tiller populations in New Zealand's perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) dairy pastures. One hypothesis is that modern genotypes are less suited to the warmer, drier weather experienced under changing climate patterns. In this study, a combination of long-term trial data (2011\textendash 2017) and a process-based pasture model (BASGRA) was used to explore the causes and possible mitigation of the observed production and population loss at three sites (dryland sites in Northland and Waikato and an irrigated site in Canterbury). Bayesian calibration was used to identify the model parameter sets that were consistent with the trial data and to identify differences in plant morphology and responses between sites. The model successfully simulated the observed differences in tiller numbers between the dryland sites, where populations and production declined rapidly after the second year and the irrigated site where populations and production were maintained. Analysis of the model calibrations along with preliminary scenario simulations suggests that increased tiller mortality associated with drought was the main cause of persistence failure at the dryland sites and that decreasing grazing pressure or breeding for tolerance to higher temperatures may not be successful in preventing this.},
