The fruit of domestic varieties has a buttery flesh when ripe. Depending on the variety, avocados have green, brown, purplish, or black skin when ripe, and may be pear-shaped, egg-shaped, or spherical. Commercially, the fruits are ripened after harvesting.  Avocado trees are partially self-pollinating, and are often propagated through grafting to maintain  predictable fruit quality and quantity. In 2019, Mexico was the world's leading producer of avocados, supplying 32\% of the global total.},

  abstract = {Plant water-use efficiency (WUE) describes the ratio of carbon gain to water loss during photosynthesis. It has been shown that WUE varies among crop genotypes, and crops with high WUE can increase agricultural production in the face of finite water supply. We used measures of leaf carbon isotopic composition to compare WUE among 24 cultivars of Persea americana Mill (avocado) to determine genotypic variability in WUE, identify potentially efficient cultivars, and to better understand how breeding for yield and fruit quality has affected WUE. To validate carbon isotope measurements, we also measured leaf photosynthetic gas exchange of water and carbon, and leaf and stem functional traits of cultivars with the highest and lowest carbon isotope composition to quantify actual WUE ranges during photosynthesis. Our results indicate large variation in WUE among cultivars and coordination among functional traits that structure trade-offs in water loss and carbon gain. Identifying cultivars of subtropical tree crops that are efficient in terms of water use is critical for maintaining a high level of food production under limited water supply. Plant functional traits, including carbon isotopes, appear to be an effective tool for identifying species or genotypes with particular carbon and water economies in managed ecosystems.},

In addition, documentation of interactions among environmental fac\- tors, floral gene expression and subsequent flower development is limited. Thus, in this research, the effects of environmental factors on the temporal expression patterns of genes related to flowering time, floral meristem identity and floral organ identity were quantified in buds relative to inflorescence number. `Hass' avocado trees were subjected to four different environmental conditions: optimal growth condition (OGC) (warm temperature, well-watered, photosynthetic active radiation {$>$} 900 {$\mu$}moles m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1), low temperature (LT), low soil moisture (LSM) or low light intensity (LLI) for 8 weeks, followed by OGC for 6 weeks. Bud expression of homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana flowering genes FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), LEAFY (LFY), APETALA1 (AP1), APETALA2 (AP2), APETALA3 (AP3), PISTILLATA.1 (PI.1), AGAMOUS.1 (AG.1) and AGAMOUS.3 (AG.3) were quantified over time. Only buds of LT-treated trees flowered. At the start of the experiment (week 0), buds of all trees expressed PaLFY, PaAP1 and PaAP2. After 4 weeks of treatment, bud PaAP1 expression was greater than in week 0 and continued to increase through week 8 only in LT-treated trees, whereas by week 8 PaLFY expression increased in LT- and LSM-treated trees. By week 10 (2 weeks after transfer to OGC), bud PaFT expression increased only in LT-treated trees, followed by activation of downstream floral organ identity genes PaAP3, PaPI.1, PaAG.1 and PaAG.3 by week 12. For OGC-, LSM- and LLI-treated trees, bud PaAP1, PaFT, PaAP3, PaPI.1 and PaAG.1 expression remained low, with PaAG.3 transcripts undetected at week 12. These trees did not flower. Among environmental factors tested, only LT increased bud expression of both PaLFY and PaAP1, which likely conferred floral meristem determinacy since transfer of LT-treated trees to OGC did not prevent flowering but activated PaFT, downstream floral organ identity genes, and flowering. The results suggest `Hass' avocado floral development is promoted by low temperature-dependent floral induction and warm temperature-dependent floral organogenesis.},

Lifespan of spring-born roots were 61 and 59\% greater than those born during autumn and summer, respectively and soil depth and root diameter were positively correlated with root longevity. Lifespan of thinner roots ({$<$}0.2 mm) in the BS and VS plots were 49 and 33\% greater than GC respectively. Avocado trees grown in contrasting condition compared with their native habitat show high morphological root plasticity, in response to resource and non-resource competition when grown in mixed stands.},

Trees were planted in 200 L pots in one of four soil types: clay (C), clay loam (CL), sandy loam (SL) or sand (S). Prior to planting, Ca content in each soil was in the normal range of availability, although the Ca concentration was highest in C soil. After two years of tree development, dry weights of shoots and roots were significantly higher in the SL and S soils than in C soil. Trees in the C soil had higher wood dry weight than trees in SL or S soils. The Ca contents (absolute quantities, not concentrations) in the roots, shoots and whole tree were significantly lower in the C soil than in the SL or S soils. The K/Ca ratio of trees in the C soil (K/Ca = 1.5) was significantly higher than that in the other soil types. Stem water potential was significantly lower for trees in the C soil compared to the other soils. These results indicate that Ca absorption and partitioning in young avocado trees varies with soil texture, probably associated with soil effects on root growth and/or plant water status.},

  abstract = {The results of research on the water relations and irrigation need of avocado are collated and reviewed in an attempt to link fundamental studies on crop physiology to irrigation practices. Background information is given on the centre of origin (Mexico and Central America) and the three distinct ecological areas where avocados are grown commercially: (1) Cool, semi-arid climates with winter-dominant rainfall (e.g. Southern California, Chile, Israel); (2) Humid, subtropical climates with summer-dominant rainfall (e.g. eastern Australia, Mexico, South Africa); and (3) Tropical or semi-tropical climates also with summer-dominant rainfall (e.g. Brazil, Florida and Indonesia). Most of the research reported has been done in Australia, California, Israel and South Africa. There are three ecological races that are given varietal status within the species: Persea americana var. drymifolia (Mexican race), P. americana var. guatemalensis (Guatemalan race) and P. americana var. americana (Antillean, West Indian or Lowland race). Interracial crossing has taken place. This paper summarises the effects of water deficits on the development processes of the crop and then reviews plant\textendash water relations, crop water requirements, water productivity and irrigation systems. Shoot growth in mature trees is synchronised into flushes. Flower initiation occurs in the autumn, with flowering in late winter and spring. Flowers form on the ends of the branches. A large heavily flowering tree may have over a million flowers, but only produce 200\textendash 300 fruits. Fruit load adjustment occurs by shedding during the first three to four weeks after fruit set and again in early summer. Water deficits during critical stages of fruit ontogeny have been linked to fruit disorders such as ring-neck. Reproductive growth is very resistant to water stress (compared with vegetative growth). Avocado is conventionally considered to be shallow rooted, although roots extend to depths greater than 1.5 m. The majority of feeder roots are found in the top 0.60 m of soil and root extension can continue throughout the year. Leaves develop a waxy cuticle on both surfaces, which is interrupted by stomata on the abaxial surface (350\textendash 510 mm-2), many of which are blocked by wax. Stomata are also present on the sepals and petals at low densities (and on young fruit). During flowering, the canopy surface area available for water loss is considerably increased. Stomatal closure is an early indicator of water stress, which together with associated changes in leaf anatomy, restricts CO2 diffusion. There have only been a few attempts to measure the actual water use of avocado trees. In Mediterranean-type climates, peak rates of water use (in summer) appear to be between 3 and 5 mm d-1. For mature trees, the crop coefficient (Kc) is usually within the range 0.4\textendash 0.6. The best estimate of water productivity is between 1 and 2 kg fruit m-3. Soil flooding and the resultant reduction in oxygen level can damage roots even in the absence of root rot. Avocado is particularly sensitive to salinity, notably that caused by chloride ions. Rootstocks vary in their sensitivity. Both drip and under-tree microsprinklers have been/are successfully used to irrigate avocado trees. Mulching of young trees is a recommended water conservation measure and has other benefits. A large proportion of the research reviewed has been published in the `grey' literature as conference papers and annual reports. Sometimes, this is at the expense of reporting the science on which the recommendations are based in peer-reviewed papers. The pressures on irrigators to improve water productivity are considered.},

  abstract = {As global pressure on water resources intensifies, it is essential that scientists understand the role that water plays in the development of crops and how such knowledge can be applied to improve water productivity. Linking crop physiology, agronomy and irrigation practices, this book focuses on eleven key fruit crops upon which millions of people in the tropics and subtropics depend for their livelihoods (avocado, cashew, Citrus spp., date palm, lychee, macadamia, mango, olive, papaya, passion fruit and pineapple). Each chapter reviews international irrigation research on an individual fruit crop, identifying opportunities for improving the effectiveness of water allocation and encouraging readers to link scientific knowledge with practical applications. Clearly written and well illustrated, this is an ideal resource for engineers, agronomists and researchers concerned with how the productivity of irrigated agriculture can be improved, in the context of climate change, and the need for growers to demonstrate good irrigation practices.},

  abstract = {Avocado (Persea americana Mill.) is a fruit-tree species highly susceptible to water deficit, which makes irrigation management a difficult task for growers. When irrigation is inadequate, trees suffer growth reduction, fruit losses, and roots damage. This study addressed the question of how to assess water stress in avocado trees and the considerations to choose an indicator to measure the plant water stress. In this work the sensitivity and variability of two water stress indicators in response to water deficit were analyzed: stem water potential (SWP) and maximum daily trunk shrinkage (MDTS). During a period of high water demand, avocado trees planted in a clay loam soil were subjected to water stress by withholding irrigation and compared to control trees irrigated according to the maximal crop evapotranspiration. During the study, avocado trees reached a minimum SWP of -0.9 MPa and a maximum MDTS of \textasciitilde{} 285 \textmu m. To better understand avocado tree response to water deficit, leaf abscisic acid, stomatal conductance, soil moisture, and vapor pressure deficit were also measured. Interestingly, it was found that water stress indicators showed differences with control after 3 d of withholding irrigation. It was possible to observe that MDTS was more sensitive in detecting water stress than SWP, signal strength of 4.5 vs. 1.2 respectively; however, MDTS higher variability counteracted its performance as stress indicator, coefficient of variation of 32\% vs. 9\%, respectively. This study confirms that monitoring water stress is an important tool for avocado irrigation management and should consider both, the sensitivity and variability of the indicator.},

  abstract = {The avocado (Persea americana) is a major crop commodity worldwide. Moreover, avocado, a paleopolyploid, is an evolutionary ``outpost'' among flowering plants, representing a basal lineage (the magnoliid clade) near the origin of the flowering plants themselves. Following centuries of selective breeding, avocado germplasm has been characterized at the level of microsatellite and RFLP markers. Nonetheless, little is known beyond these general diversity estimates, and much work remains to be done to develop avocado as a major subtropical-zone crop. Among the goals of avocado improvement are to develop varieties with fruit that will ``store'' better on the tree, show uniform ripening and have better post-harvest storage. Avocado transcriptome sequencing, genome mapping and partial genomic sequencing will represent a major step toward the goal of sequencing the entire avocado genome, which is expected to aid in improving avocado varieties and production, as well as understanding the evolution of flowers from non-flowering seed plants (gymnosperms). Additionally, continued evolutionary and other comparative studies of flower and fruit development in different avocado strains can be accomplished at the gene expression level, including in comparison with avocado relatives, and these should provide important insights into the genetic regulation of fruit development in basal angiosperms.

  abstract = {Two cultivars of avocado (Persea americana Mill., `Fuerte' and `Hass') plants, grown in 50 l containers, were studied under two irrigation regimes for 6 months in order to evaluate the growth response and leaf physiological and anatomical changes induced by moderate water stress. Irrigation was applied when soil water potential reached at \`A0.03 and \`A0.5 MPa for the wet and dry treatments, respectively. Leaf anatomy changed in water-stressed leaves, which could have accounted for the decreased stomatal conductance. Photosynthesis is inhibited by reducing the diffusion of CO2 to the chloroplast, both by stomatal closure and changes in mesophyll structure, which decreases the conductance to CO2 diffusion within the leaf. Predawn leaf water potential (C) declined by 0.9 MPa for `Fuerte' and 1.2 MPa for `Hass' after 12 days of withholding water, whereas the turgor potential (Cp) remained positive due to a decrease in the osmotic potential (Cp) in both cultivars. The reduction in osmotic potential was mainly due to dehydration and only partly related to active accumulation of solutes. Tissue elasticity seems to be the predominant physiological mechanism of drought adaptation of avocado. Growth data suggests that `Hass' seems to be more affected by moderate water stress. \# 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We assessed the suitability of these alternatives by identifying the potential changes in the distribution of coffee, cocoa and the 100 most common agroforestry trees found in Mesoamerica. Here we show that cocoa could potentially become an alternative in most of coffee vulnerable areas. Agroforestry with currently preferred tree species is highly vulnerable to future climate change. Transforming agroforestry systems by changing tree species composition may be the best approach to adapt most of the coffee and cocoa production areas.

  abstract = {The correct fertilisation of avocado trees is a key management activity requiring monitoring of tree nutrient levels. To determine if a fertiliser programme is meeting the needs of the trees a sample of leaves is usually analysed for mineral content. When interpreting leaf test results it is important to identify if the concentrations of individual minerals in the leaves are excessive or deficient so that corrective action can be taken. Presenting this information in an easy to understand format would be helpful to avocado growers to see how their fertiliser programme is working. A survey of orchards comparing yields from the AIC database to leaf test results from Hill Laboratories has been combined to calculate leaf target levels across different yield classes. The range of mineral values was similar across the different yield classes. Regression analysis showed that as yield increased so did the average amount of calcium, magnesium, sulphur and zinc while potassium levels decreased. Boron only tended to increase with yield class. There was little difference in the mineral content of leaves between trees with and without fruit. Compared to leaf target levels in other countries the New Zealand 'Hass' leaf targets calculated here for zinc and boron are low while other minerals are within the normal range of leaf values reported overseas. Leaf boron levels appeared to be very low and were just above deficient levels. The leaf nitrogen levels tended to be high compared to other countries. Presenting leaf test results using a bar chart based on indices of the average and variation around the average was easy to read and interpret. The best use of leaf test results is to determine if the targets are met for the crop in the current year as leaf test results were poorly related to the yield in the following year. The target values for 95\% of trees meeting leaf target levels were closely aligned to the leaf target values published in other countries. The 95\% leaf target levels could be considered the best target values to ensure good cropping levels.},

To verify these scales, a method of data mining was applied; a decision tree developed by this method confirmed the high accuracy and adequacy of the suggested grouping.},

Avocado Persea americana benefits from insect pollination, however, a better understanding of the role of pollinators and their contribution to the production of this globally important crop is needed. In this study, we carried out a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies investigating the pollination ecology of avocado to answer the following questions: (a) Are there any research gaps in terms of geographic location or scientific focus? (b) What is the effect of insect pollinators on avocado pollination and production? (c) Which pollinators are the most abundant and effective and how does this vary across location? (d) How can insect pollination be improved for higher yields? (e) What are the current evidence gaps and what should be the focus of future research? Research from many regions of the globe has been published, however, results showed that there is limited information from key avocado producing countries such as Mexico and the Dominican Republic. In most studies, insects were shown to contribute greatly to pollination, fruit set and yield. Honeybees Apis mellifera were important pollinators in many regions due to their efficiency and high abundance, however, many wild pollinators also visited avocado flowers and were the most frequent visitors in over 50\% of studies. This study also highlighted the effectiveness of stingless bees (Meliponini) and blow flies (Calliphoridae) as avocado pollinators although, for the majority of flower visitors, there is a lack of data on pollinator efficiency. For optimal yields, growers should ensure a sufficient abundance of pollinators in their orchards either through increasing honeybee hive density or, for a more sustainable approach, by managing wild pollinators through practices that protect or promote natural habitat.},

Photoassimilates were never limiting, although flower and fruitlet abscission occurred during and long after this competitive period. Carbohydrate availability was sufficient to support the growth of both developing fruitlets and leaves during early stages of reproductive development, and it did not limit fruitlet growth or stimulate fruitlet abscission.},

Incorporating non-traditional fruits and vegetables into the Mediterranean diet could provide greater flexibility in suitable food choices for people who struggle to adhere to recommended healthy dietary patterns, and it could also provide greater adaptability for people living outside of the Mediterranean region who are interested in adopting the diet. The avocado fruit thrives in a Mediterranean climate, is produced in the region, and is rich in oleic acid and fiber, yet avocados are not commonly consumed within the traditional Mediterranean diet.

The study aimed to provide key information about the farms for those involved in the design of programs and public policies directed to growers. The data were scrutinized through Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Cluster Analysis. The sample was made up of 214 growers of the crop. Quantitative and qualitative variables were employed for the MCA, which rendered 40 dimensions, out of which 16 accounted for 70\% of the total inertia (variance) found in the data. These 16 dimensions were used as input for the Cluster Analysis, which provided the following results: 52\%, 32\% and 15\% of the farms were located in Clusters 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The identified farm types can be associated to peasant (Cluster 1) and commercial (Cluster 3) agricultural schemes, plus a transition between them (Cluster 2). The most discriminating variables regarding such categorization were: farm size, farm registry at ICA (Colombian Agricultural Institute), Avocado cv. Hass yield, labor source, presence of crops other than avocado, existence of formal commercial alliances and technical assistance type. The percentage of farmers belonging to grower organizations was high in the three clusters. Growers in Clusters 3 and 2 had established formal commercial alliances which enabled them to access better sale prices for the crop. A trend towards establishing cv. Hass as a monocrop is observed, which may threaten both crop biodiversity and the food security of peasant growers.},

However, morphology-based approaches are prone to omission and commission errors due to the shape and size of structuring elements. To reduce the error rate in ITD tasks, we introduce a morphological transform that is based on the local maxima segmentation (Cumulative Summation of Extended Maxima transform (SEMAX)) with the aim to enhance the seed selection by extracting information collected from different heights. Validation is performed on data collected from the plantations of citrus and avocado using different measures of precision. The results obtained by the SEMAX approach show that the devised ITD algorithm provides enough accuracy, and achieves the lowest false-negative rate than other compared state-of-art approaches do.},

Low outcrossing rates might be a factor contributing to low yields. It is hypothesized that self-fertilized flowers and resulting fruit abscise at a much higher rate than fruit that are the product of outcrossing. However, significant relationships between outcrossing rates and yields have only been established in a few avocado studies. The objective of this research was to investigate the importance of outcrossing to yield in a commercial `Hass' orchard containing `Bacon', an effective pollinizer of `Hass'. Microsatellite markers were used to determine the rate of outcrossing of fruit persisting to harvest on `Hass' trees. Experiments were conducted during sequential on- and off-crop years. During both years, outcrossing rates were not related to yield or alternate bearing. These results indicate that outcrossing was not the primary factor affecting flower and fruit persistence and ultimately yield in this orchard for the two sequential years of this research.},

  abstract = {Despite profuse flowering, `Hass' avocado (Persea americana Mill.) yields are low because of excessive flower and fruit abscission. Whether the dynamics of flower and fruit abscission are influenced by or contribute to alternate bearing, the production of a heavy on-crop followed by a light off-crop that is characteristic of many avocado cultivars, remains unresolved. The objective of this research was to determine whether abscission of reproductive structures from `Hass' avocado trees during specific developmental stages, including flowering, fruit development, and fruit maturity, was influenced by crop status of the current or preceding year. Abscised reproductive structures were collected from commercially bearing trees during two complete crop years. Flower abscission began at about the same time but peaked 1 month later in the off-crop year compared with the on-crop year. Peak abscission rates were lower during the off-crop year than the on-crop year (compare 1836 {$\pm$} 403 to 5378 {$\pm$} 856 flowers per day and 50 {$\pm$} 18 to 280 {$\pm$} 23 immature fruit per day, respectively). The off- or on-crop status of the tree did not influence the percentage fruit set, average fruit diameter, or biomass of individual fruit that abscised at similar phenological stages. Furthermore, flower and fruit abscission were not influenced by the number of mature fruit from the previous year's crop. In both years of the research, as immature fruit abscission declined, abscission of the preceding year's crop increased, indicating that the processes were controlled independently. During the study, neither weather conditions nor tree nutrient status were associated with key abscission events. Taken together, these results provide evidence that the previous year's yield does not influence flower or fruit abscission and the seasonal abscission of reproductive structures is an independent process that does not contribute to alternate bearing of `Hass' avocado.},

  abstract = {In Chile, expansion of avocado production has resulted in many orchards established in marginal soils that are poorly drained and have high soil water-to-air ratios when soil moisture is at field capacity. However, avocado trees are sensitive to poor soil aeration. A study was conducted to determine the effects of different soil waterto-air ratios (W/A) on biomass and nutrient content of avocado trees. Two-yearold avocado trees were grown for 2 seasons in containers in soils, with different W/A, collected from different avocado growing regions of Chile. There were five treatments corresponding to each of the five soils. At field capacity, the two-season average W/A was 1.7, 1.3, 0.6, 0.4 or 0.3 for treatments T1, T2, T3, T4, or T5, respectively. The same amount of fertilizer was applied to each soil. Mineral element concentrations and total mineral element contents in leaves, shoots, wood and roots were determined for each tree in each treatment at the end of the experimental period. Shoot and root fresh and dry weights, leaf area and leaf retention were also determined. Although all treatments showed non-limiting soil oxygen conditions for avocado root growth, trees in soils with lower W/A had greater shoot and root dry weights and longer autumn leaf retention. Macro- and micronutrient concentrations in any plant tissue were not related to soil W/A. However, total tissue contents of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, C, N and B in roots and whole plants were highest in treatments with lower soil W/A. The results indicate that soil W/A significantly affects growth and mineral nutrition of avocado trees and should be considered for avocado site selection and management.},

The tree is basically grown as the forest species but later on as a shade growing tree under coffee cultivation because of high nutritional and medicinal values of fruit and it makes for wider diversity. Thereafter it was entered into the other parts of the world from Central America and Mexico. The tree is of multipurpose in nature and also helps to avoid the soil and water erosion by way of its wider spread canopy. Generally, Avocado leafs reduce the beating action of rain drops which in-turn minimize the soil erosion. The soil enrichment by adding the leaf litter continuously is an advantage in the coffee plantations. It yields in the additional economic returns after three to five years of establishment. Hence, the establishment of shade tree under coffee ecosystem will give additional income to the coffee growers, which mainly helps on lean period of coffee cultivation.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the physical, chemical and nutritional parameters associated with the quality of Hass avocado in eight localities of the department of Antioquia based on descriptive statistics. Additionally, the quality was related to the localities through a multivariate analysis. As a result, quality at preharvest parameters of Hass avocados cultivated in Antioquia is similar or superior to that reported internationally based on physical and chemical variables. In addition, a relationship was established between the quality of fruits and the plots where these were cultivated, which allowed discriminating fruits by their region of origin. This work shows an approach to the determination of quality parameters in Hass avocado in Colombia and how they can be related to the characteristics of its productive system, which can lead to defining a product with added value.},

To test this hypothesis, we measured variation in plant traits (fruit and seed size, seed germination, and plant growth), chemical defenses (total phenolics), and resistance against two leaf-chewing insect herbivores\textemdash a specialist (               Copaxa multifenestrata               ) and a generalist (               Spodoptera frugiperda               )\textemdash among seven avocado genotypes across a domestication gradient: wild (ancestral) genotypes, five (intermediate) landraces (``Blanco,'' ``Lonjas,'' ``Vargas,'' ``Zarcoli,'' and ``Rodolfo''), and the cultivated (modern) ``Hass.'' Our results showed that seeds from ``Hass'' have a lower germination rate and slower growth and have shorter fruits and seeds than the landraces and wild genotypes. ``Hass'' leaves also had lower amounts of total phenolics than the landraces; however, no differences were found between ``Hass'' and the wild genotypes. There was no effect of genotype on larval mass gained for both herbivores. However,               C. multifenestrata               had longer larval longevity on ``Hass'' and the wild genotypes, whereas               S. frugiperda               larval longevity showed no differences among genotypes. Moreover,               C. multifenestrata               inflicted more damage on ``Hass,'' whereas               S. frugiperda               inflicted more damage on ``Lonjas'' than on the other genotypes. In general, bigger fruit and seeds were positively correlated with plant size and phenolic content, and total phenolics were positively correlated with               S. frugiperda               and negatively correlated with               C. multifenestrata               larval performance. However, despite the genotypic variation in plant traits, phenolic content, and resistance against two herbivores with different levels of specialization, there was no clear support for the ``plant domestication-reduced defense'' hypothesis in avocado.},

The research was conducted in Chile's Central Valley on a clay loam soil at the surface and sandy loam from 0.3 to 0.9~m. Climate zone is sub-humid, Mediterranean-type. A completely randomized block design was used with four applied water treatments (25, 50, 75, and 100\% of reference evapotranspiration, ETo), estimated on the basis of mean daily pan evaporation of the previous week, and four replicates each consisting of six trees. Avocado size and production increased significantly as applied water increased to the level equivalent to 75\% ETo. Avocado production differed during the three seasons. For the 2005/2006 and 2007/2008 seasons, the highest yield were 29.6 and 26.9 t ha-1 with 10,071 and 8887~m3 ha-1 season-1, respectively. The lowest production was observed for the 2006/2007 season when climatic conditions were adverse, and the highest production was obtained with 100\% ETo. Production was consistently less in the `off-crop' years due to alternate bearing for all treatments. However, yield of the 25\% and 50\% ETo represented only 22\% of the yield obtained in the two `on-crop' years, whereas the yield of 75 and 100\% ETo in the off year reached 42\% of the average yield of the 2 years of high production. The increasing trend in alternate bearing in the drier treatments emphasizes the need to maintain adequate water supply in avocado even in off-crop years.},

  abstract = {Fruit and vegetative growth, along with the normal development of the permanent structures of the tree, require energy and carbon building blocks, The role of starch reserves in supplementing the daily photosynthate production is of vital importance. Low starch reserves at the beginning of a new reproductive season, facilitate an off-year which is often followed by a big yield with small fruit the following season. Although the starch reserve available in the plant is not the only factor determining on/off-years, it plays a major role in many plant processes. For the producer it is important to promote the build up of reserves and to avoid any unnecessary utilization of these reserves. For the purpose of this paper the carbohydrate demand and storage capacity of six-year-old Hass avocado trees will be dealt with for the period immediately after harvest of an offyear to immediately after harvest of the subsequent on-year. In addition, the effect of fruit load on the accumulation and utilization of starch under induced on and off-year situations will be discussed. The results illustrate that the bulk of tree carbohydrate reserves are found in the roots and wood. Fruit thinning seems to be necessary and it will be necessary to determine the optimum fruit load a tree can handle when taking into account the cultivar, locality, soil conditions, tree age and tree size.},

On the other hand, SWC has been found to increase after each water supply and decrease in the interval separating two successive irrigations. In addition, crop water requirements of avocado were found to be as much as 622 mm (for the 2016 dataset) and 380 mm (for the 2018 dataset) during the growing season from June throughout September.

On a dry weight basis, total soluble sugar (TSS) concentrations ranged from 33.0 to 236.0 mg{$\cdot$}g\textendash 1 dry weight and were high compared to starch concentration (2.0 to 109.0 mg{$\cdot$}g\textendash 1 dry weight) in all measured organs (stems, leaves, trunks and roots). The seven carbon (C7) sugars, D-mannoheptulose and perseitol, were the dominant soluble sugars detected. The highest starch and TSS concentrations were found in stem tissues, and in stems, a distinct seasonal fluctuation in starch and TSS concentrations was observed. This coincided with vegetative growth flushes over both sampling years. Stem TSS and starch concentrations increased beginning in autumn, with cessation of shoot growth, until midwinter, possibly due to storage of photosynthate produced during the winter photosynthetic period. TSS peaked in midwinter, while starch increased throughout the winter to a maximum level in early spring. A second peak in stem TSS was observed in midsummer following flowering and spring shoot growth. At this time, stem starch concentration also decreased to the lowest level of the year. This complementary cycling between stem TSS and starch suggests that a conversion of starch to sugars occurs to support vegetative growth and flowering, while sugars produced photosynthetically may be allocated directly to support flowering and fruit production.},

  abstract = {Changes in soluble sugar and starch reserves in avocado (Persea americana Mill. on `Duke 7' rootstock) fruit were followed during growth and development and during low temperature storage and ripening. During the period of rapid fruit size expansion, soluble sugars accounted for most of the increase in fruit tissue biomass (peel: 17\% to 22\%, flesh: 40\% to 44\%, seed: 32\% to 41\% of the dry weight). More than half of the fruit total soluble sugars (TSS) was comprised of the seven carbon (C7) heptose sugar, D-mannoheptulose, and its polyol form, perseitol, with the balance being accounted for by the more common hexose sugars, glucose and fructose. Sugar content in the flesh tissues declined sharply as oil accumulation commenced. TSS declines in the seed were accompanied by a large accumulation of starch ({$\approx$}30\% of the dry weight). During postharvest storage at 1 or 5 \textdegree C, TSS in peel and flesh tissues declined slowly over the storage period. Substantial decreases in TSS, and especially in the C7 sugars, was observed in peel and flesh tissues during fruit ripening. These results suggest that the C7 sugars play an important role, not only in metabolic processes associated with fruit development, but also in respiratory processes associated with postharvest physiology and fruit ripening.},

  abstract = {Most research on the agricultural impacts of climate change has focused on the major annual crops, yet perennial cropping systems are less adaptable and thus potentially more susceptible to damage. In regions where perennial crops are economically and culturally important, improved assessments of yield responses to future climate are needed to prioritize adaptation strategies. These impact assessments, in turn, must rely on climate and crop models that contain often poorly defined uncertainties. We evaluated the impact of climate change on six major perennial crops in California: wine grapes, almonds, table grapes, oranges, walnuts, and avocados. Outputs from multiple climate models were used to evaluate climate uncertainty, while multiple statistical crop models, derived by resampling historical databases, were used to address crop response uncertainties. We find that, despite these uncertainties, climate change in California is very likely to put downward pressure on yields of almonds, walnuts, avocados, and table grapes by 2050. Without CO2 fertilization or adaptation measures, projected losses range from 0 to {$>$}40\% depending on the crop and the trajectory of climate change. Climate change uncertainty generally had a larger impact on projections than crop model uncertainty, although the latter was substantial for several crops. Opportunities for expansion into cooler regions were identified, but this adaptation would require substantial investments and may be limited by non-climatic constraints. Given the long time scales for growth and production of orchards and vineyards (\$30 years), climate change should be an important factor in selecting perennial varieties and deciding whether and where perennials should be planted.},

The months and climatic variables of greatest importance to each crop were used to develop regressions relating yield to climatic conditions. For most crops, fairly simple equations using only 2\textendash 3 variables explained more than two-thirds of observed yield variance. The types of variables and months identified suggest that relatively poorly understood processes such as crop infection, pollination, and dormancy may be important mechanisms by which climate influences crop yield. Recent climatic trends have had mixed effects on crop yields, with orange and walnut yields aided, avocado yields hurt, and most crops little affected by recent climatic trends. Yieldclimate relationships can provide a foundation for forecasting crop production within a year and for projecting the impact of future climate changes.},

  abstract = {An agrometeorological model was developed for assessing the effect of heat stress during flowering and early fruit set on avocado (Persea americana Mill) yields. This model accounted for heat stress only and was considered to occur when the daily maximum temperature was {$>$}33\textdegree C. In addition to the daily maximum temperature, the model considered the duration of such temperatures in days, as well as the timing of the occurrences of such temperatures in relation to the flowering and early fruit set of 'Fuerte' avocado. The specifications of the climatic data inputs are based on experimental results in the temperature range of 33\textdegree{} to 43\textdegree C extrapolated linearly. A series of weighting factors were used for the duration of heat spells in days. In the temperature range of 33\textdegree{} to 35\textdegree{} the weighting was n - 1; for the 36\textdegree{} to 38\textdegree{} range, 1.4n; and for the 39\textdegree{} to 43\textdegree C range, 2.0n. Weighting factors for the timing of the occurrence of heat spells follow closely the near-normal percentage distribution curve of open flowers. At bud burst in March, the weighting is 0.4, increasing to 1.3 at early fruit set by mid-May and decreasing rapidly to 0.3 by the end of June. The functional relationship between the model heat stress output and the yield of avocado for an irrigated, high-yielding plantation shows fairly good correlation, r2 = 0.42 to 0.51, depending on the statistical method used. The agreement between the heat stress index and the yield of avocados is closely related only during those years when the plantation is subject to heat stress indexes greater than 10. Testing the model on independent data commenced in 1985 and includes a yield memory term.},

Half of the interannual variance in yield was explained by this model for the Hass variety, and a third of the interannual variance for the Fuerte, Ettinger and Nabel varieties. The scatter of the annual yields, especially at lower Heat Stress Index values, is due to alternation of the fruit trees associated with heavy crops and other non-climatological factors. The varietal sensitivity to heat stress was determined by the regression slopes indicating the expected yield loss per unit heat stress. Fuerte is the most sensitive variety to heat stress. Among the three less sensitive varieties to heat stress, Ettinger, Hass and Nabel, there is no significant difference in their sensitivity.},

  abstract = {To protect groundwater from potential nitrate pollution, `Hass' avocado (Persea americana Mill.) growers in California divide the total annual soil-applied nitrogen (N) fertilizer (N at 56 to 168 kg{$\cdot$}ha\textendash 1) into small applications made during the period from late January to early November. However, no research had been conducted to test the efficacy of this fertilization practice, and there was concern that the amount of N in the individual applications may be too little to meet the demand of the tree at some stages of its phenology. The research presented herein addressed the question of whether yield of `Hass' avocado could be increased by doubling the amount of N currently applied during specific stages of tree phenology. The control in this experiment was the practice of annually applying N as NH4NO3 at 168 kg{$\cdot$}ha\textendash 1 (168 trees/ ha) in six small doses of N at 28 kg{$\cdot$}ha\textendash 1 in January, February, April, June, July, and November. From these six application times, five were selected on the basis of tree phenology and additional N as NH4NO3 at 28 kg{$\cdot$}ha\textendash 1 was applied at each time for total annual N of 196 kg{$\cdot$}ha\textendash 1. Two phenological stages were identified for which N application at 56 kg{$\cdot$}ha\textendash 1 in a single application (double dose of N) significantly increased the 4-year cumulative yield (kilograms fruit per tree) 30\% and 39\%, respectively, compared to control trees (P {$\leq$} 0.01). In each case, more than 70\% of the net increase in yield was commercially valuable large size fruit (178 to 325 g/fruit). The two phenological stages were when shoot apical buds have four or more secondary axis inflorescence meristems present (mid-November); and during anthesis to early fruit set and initiation of the vegetative shoot flush at the apex of indeterminate floral shoots (about mid-April). When the double dose of N was applied at either of these two stages, the kilograms and number of large size fruit averaged across the 4 years of the study was significantly greater than the control trees (P {$\leq$} 0.01). Averaged across the 4 years of the study, only the November treatment increased yield compared to the control trees (P {$\leq$} 0.05). Application of the double dose of N at flower initiation (January), during early-stage gynoecium development (February), or during June drop had no significant effect on average or cumulative yield or fruit size compared to control trees. Application of the double dose of N in April significantly reduced the severity of alternate bearing (P {$\leq$} 0.05). Yield was not significantly correlated with leaf N concentration. Time and rate of N application are factors that can be optimized to increase yield, fruit size, and annual cropping of `Hass' avocado. When the amounts of N applied were equal (196 kg{$\cdot$}ha\textendash 1), time of application was the more important factor.},

  abstract = {To remain profitable in an era of increasingly expensive inputs to crop production (land, labor, water, fertilizer, etc.), avocado growers worldwide must increase yield of high quality commercially valuable size fruit per hectare, while reducing production costs. Optimizing tree nutrient status, irrigation and canopy management are fundamental to achieving this goal. All plants, including `Hass' avocado trees, require 17 essential elements; 14 are mineral nutrients that are found in soil, organic matter and some sources of irrigation water and can also be supplied as soilor foliar-applied fertilizers. For maximum yield and optimal fruit size, avocado trees must have adequate amounts of each nutrient at each stage of tree phenology. When the amount of one or more nutrients is low, yield will be reduced to the level supported by the least abundant nutrient. Properly timing soil- and foliar-applied fertilizers to meet the needs of `Hass' avocado trees during phenological stages of high nutrient demand is a cost-effective strategy for optimizing tree nutrient status that can increase yield and fruit size, improve fertilizer-use efficiency, protect the environment and increase grower net profit. As examples, foliar-applied boron to `Hass' avocado trees at the cauliflower stage of inflorescence development increased ovule viability, number of ovules penetrated by pollen tubes, and yield. Foliar-applied potassium phosphite at this stage of tree phenology increased avocado fruit size. Doubling soil-applied nitrogen (N) during fruit set increased yield and reduced alternate bearing. Back-to-back soil applications of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (N-P-K) during exponential fruit growth increased total yield and yield of commercially valuable size fruit. Multiple soil applications of N-P-K reduced `Hass' avocado yield compared to trees receiving multiple applications of N only or N-P-K only during exponential fruit growth. Additional principles to assist growers in developing a fertilization program to meet specific production goals will be presented.},

Fuerte was investigated over a 5-year period at Chania, Greece. The average amounts of irrigation water applied annually (in addition to rain) for the three WU levels were 238, 553 and 868 mm, respectively. Soil volumes, with a volumetric soil water content percentage (\texttheta ) corresponding to a soil water potential ({$\Psi$}s) higher than -0.1 MPa, increased markedly from 0.3 to 0.6 Ep, and slightly from 0.6 to 0.9 Ep WU levels, being 26.3, 41.7 and 52\%, respectively. Deep percolation did not occur at 0.3 Ep, was moderate but acceptable at 0.6 Ep, and high at 0.9 Ep. Root distribution was similar in all treatments. Some 72\% of the root system was concentrated in the upper 0.5 m soil layer and within 2 m on either side of the drip line. Root density (RD) increased greatly from 0.3 to 0.6 Ep, and slightly from 0.6 to 0.9 Ep level. RD in relation to \texttheta{} did not show any notable difference between WU levels. Root growth rate, estimated by the lateral to main root ratio (r), was higher in a \texttheta{} range of 20 to 30\%, corresponding to a {$\Psi$}s, range of -0.05 to -0.3 MPa for the soil in the experiment. Yield at 0.3 Ep was lower than at 0.6 and 0.9 Ep WU levels among which no significant differences were seen. Size of individual fruits and oil content were not significantly different between treatments. When water saving, deep percolation, wetted soil volume, root development, and yield quantity and quality are taken into account, then a WU level of 0.6 Ep can be considered optimal under the conditions of this experiment.},

After 10 years, trees on `Borchard' were larger than trees on all other rootstocks. Trees on all rootstocks displayed an alternate-bearing pattern, typical of avocado. Alternate-bearing was most pronounced in trees grafted onto `Topa Topa' and `Toro Canyon'. Rootstocks in the G755 series had the lowest alternate-bearing index, but also had the lowest yields. Trees on `Duke 7' and `Borchard' had the highest cumulative yields, and trees on G755A, G755B, and G755C had the lowest yields. Differences in yield were due to differences in the number of fruit per tree, not individual fruit weight. When yield was evaluated in terms of canopy efficiency (kg fruit m\textendash 3), no rootstock outperformed `Duke 7', the industry standard rootstock. Leaf concentrations of all nutrients examined (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, Cl, Mn, B, Fe, and Cu) were within, or close to the recommended ranges. P, Ca, and S were higher, and Fe was lower in high-yielding years in all rootstocks.},

  abstract = {{$<$}section class="abstract"{$><$}p{$>$}A field experiment was conducted between 1992 and 1997 in a commercial orchard of mature `Hass' avocados on Mexican seedling rootstock ({$<$}em{$>$}Persea americana{$<$}/em{$>$} Mill.) to determine how yield was influenced by the amount of irrigation water applied and the frequency of application. Three amounts of water (targeted at 90\%, 110\%, and 130\% of estimated crop evapotranspiration) were applied at three frequencies (one, twice, and seven times per week) with microsprinklers located beneath the tree canopy. The site was set up as a randomized complete block design with six blocks, each including one replicate of all irrigation treatments. One or two trees located at the center of the replicates were used to measure yields and tree size, and as the locations where samples of soil and soil water were obtained for analysis from beneath the tree canopy. The average electrical conductivity and chloride concentration of the irrigation water, corrected for rain, were 0.7 dS{$\cdot$}m\textsuperscript{-1} and 1.8 mmol{$\cdot$}L\textsuperscript{-1}, respectively. From May 1994 to Nov. 1996, salinity of the saturated-paste extracts of soil samples obtained in the 0- to 120-cm depth interval averaged {$\approx$}2 dS{$\cdot$}m\textsuperscript{-1} for all irrigation treatments. Irrigation treatments also had little influence on the maximum soil-water salinity, {$\approx$}4 dS{$\cdot$}m\textsuperscript{-1}, in and below the lower portion of the root zone. Consequently, irrigation treatments had little influence on the fraction of applied water that was not used by the crop, the leaching fraction. Chloride concentrations in leaves were affected by applied water but did not attain levels that are associated with leaf injury. Trees irrigated seven times per week had lower yields than trees that received less frequent irrigation. During the last 2 years of the experiment, when yields no longer increased with time, the yields for treatments irrigated once and twice per week increased with increasing amounts of applied water. We were able to explain the influence of both amount of applied water and soil salinity on avocado yields and leaching fraction using production function concepts. Yields increased with increasing amounts of applied water because of increased water availability for crop use before a soil-water salinity of {$\approx$}4 dS{$\cdot$}m\textsuperscript{-1} restricted water uptake. The threshold salinity above which yield decline occurred was determined to be 0.57 dS{$\cdot$}m\textsuperscript{-1} and yield declined by 65\% per unit of salinity above the threshold. Our results suggest that maximum yields of `Hass' avocado on Mexican seedling rootstock are not achievable when the average annual salinity of irrigation water, including rainfall, is greater than {$\approx$}0.6 dS{$\cdot$}m\textsuperscript{-1}.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Avocado (Persea americana) is an important tree crop globally, and the fruit have high nutritional value. Fruit-set percentages in avocado are typically less than 0.3\%, while hand-pollination often achieves about 5\% fruit set. This suggests that fruit set could be limited byinsufficient pollination. We investigated pollination processes in avocado orchards in Australia and New Zealand in order to understand whether poor pollination was limiting avocado production. We recorded no pollen deposited on more than 80\% of all female flowers. While receptive female flowers were visited multiple times by potential pollinating insects, few of them carried more than 100 pollen grains (e.g., just 6\% of flower-visiting honey bees, Apis mellifera). Honey bees, bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and flies caught off either polleniser male-phase flowers or `Hass' female-phase flowers carried different amounts of avocado pollen grains, suggesting that differences in behavior between pollinator species may affect the rate of pollen movement between pollenisers and `Hass' flowers. Improving the rate of pollen movement between cultivars and deposition in avocado orchards is critical to ensure that pollination does not limit fruit production. Our research demonstrates the importance of understanding key metrics of pollination, and provides a template for monitoring and managing pollination in avocado orchards globally.},

The results showed that the coffee-avocado did not affect the physical and chemical quality of the soil. In contrast, the microbial quality was improved with shading, indicating a greater agroecological benefit with the implementation of this AFS.},

  abstract = {Variation in environmental suitability across the geographic range of a species is common, with consequences for population health and production. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) is an effort to estimate environmental requirements of species based on associations between known geographic occurrences and environmental conditions at those sites, to allow estimation of the potential distribution of the species. We developed an ENM for Hass avocado production fields in Colombia, in which we related the distribution of avocado production lots to environmental information derived from multitemporal MODIS satellite imagery and digital elevation models. Models were calibrated using maximum entropy approaches, using likelihood and information content metrics to optimize model selection; model performance was measured in terms of omission error with respect to independent testing data. Two models were selected that presented best combinations of high information content, significance, and performance based on lower values of Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), partial receiver operating characteristic (partialROC), and low omission of independent testing data records. Suitability values from those models were compared to Hass avocado production; models were able to identify both novel areas with potential for cultivation, and sites where this crop has been planted in relatively unsuitable areas. A statistically significant positive relationship existed between suitability values from the models and avocado production, with different relationships for three technological levels. ENM approaches thus offer a useful and novel tool for exploring and designing sustainable agriculture systems, identifying areas with environmental potential in Colombia and currently not planted with Hass avocado.},

  abstract = {The areas planted with avocado in Colombia have increased to position this fruit in international markets. To achieve this goal, the offered fruits need to meet optimal production standards. The aim of this study was to identify the main physiopathologies and damages that may cause the rejection of avocado cv. Hass fruits for export purposes during pre-harvest, harvest, and processing in packinghouses, and quantify the economic impact of said exclusion criteria. Typological characterization and quantification of damages that may cause fruit rejection were performed at the laboratory, field, and packinghouses. Data were obtained from 136 Colombian productive plots with monitoring and data collection records for a minimum of five years. At the packinghouse level, data associated with factors that affect quality (both, those identified at packing plants and those detected in simulated shipments) were considered. The main causes of fruit rejection during pre-harvest and harvest were: low calibers, damage to the epidermis by insect pests from the subfamily Melolonthidae, thrips, mites, the bug Monalonion, overripe fruits, and sunburn damage. In addition, pathologies such as anthracnose and stem end rot, and problems associated with browning of vascular bundles, irregular ripening, chilling injury, and lenticel damage were highly limiting at packinghouses. The economic analysis identified losses of 5.78 and 5.68\% in farms and packinghouses, respectively, which are equivalent to US dollar (USD) 80.29 per produced ton. This work generated information that allows prioritizing strategies to improve fruit quality and reduce economic impact.},

Of the avocados (Persea americana Mill), Hass is the most commonly cultivated variety in the world, representing an important source of nutrition in numerous countries, yet its potential risks in the face of climate change are unknown. Here, we characterise current and future potential distributional areas for Hass avocado under different scenarios of climate change across the Americas. We use ecological-niche modelling approaches to explore implications of changes in climate, considering 22 general circulation models, two emissions scenarios, and six model parameterisations. The current potential distribution of Hass avocado extends across tropical America (excluding most of Amazonia), including some areas at higher latitudes. Future projections show stability in potential distribution. Range expansions are expected mainly in temperate areas, and range contractions are related to temperature and precipitation increases, mostly in Amazonia. Model parametrisations contributed the most to overall variation in future projections, followed by climate models, and then emissions scenarios. Our conclusion of relative stability for the crop's potential distribution is still subject to effects on other components of avocado production systems, and may be vulnerable to extreme phenomena.},

Currently, Colombia is a very dynamic country where the cultivated area and volumes of exported fruits have been increasing year after year. This situation poses a challenge for the country, which must produce fruits with excellent parameters of ripening, external and internal quality. This study used a series of elements associated with quality in avocado and its application in tropical conditions, which were determined based on reports from the world scientific literature reported in journals, books, manuals and conferences. In addition, information obtained from commercial esays on plantations and the experiences of packing and marketing companies in Colombia was used. The approach presented here is associated with a modern concept of quality in the food industry and how it can be applied to the avocado value chain; preharvest aspects that determine quality, management practices conducive to improving quality, and harvest parameters and their relationship with quality were also used. This study generated alternatives for increasing the added value in the avocado production system based on quality parameters and identified delays in the supply chain of this important agro-industry under tropical conditions.},

One of the major limitations is the avocado wilt complex disease (AWC) caused by biotic and abiotic factors which have increased under the El Ni\~no southern oscillation ENSO phenomenon (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na). The objective of this study was to evaluate different strategies for mitigating the adverse effects associated with the ENSO phenomenon and AWC in avocado crops. We evaluated native materials, mulches, and parameters associated with the production of seedlings and planting practices in the field. The response variables tested were plant development, incidence, severity, mortality, and microbial dynamics, among others. The results indicated that native genotypes of Persea americana had different levels of adaptability to drought and flooding conditions. These genotypes also showed some degree of resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi and Verticillium sp. infection with several degrees of rootstock-scion incompatibility with the Hass cultivar. In addition, mulch reduced the variability of soil moisture and temperature in the soil profile. Adequate selection of genotypes and new tools for planting have decreased the susceptibility to adverse effects associated with the ENSO phenomenon and the incidence and mortality caused by diseases under drought and flooding conditions. This work presents alternatives to mitigate adverse effects of climate variability in avocado crops under tropical conditions.},

Consequently, the sustainability of water intensive crops, such as avocado, is threatened when water becomes scarce and expensive, or when growers must use saline water supplies that reduce crop yields. A variety of irrigation technologies and water management practices are now recommended to help growers through times of limited water supplies and elevated salinity levels. To examine how growers adopt different practices and combinations of practices, we collected data from a sample of avocado growers in California. We used Kohonen self-organizing maps, and developed logit models to identify the most common bundles of technologies and management practices that growers are using to deal with water scarcity. We test the validity of the proposed bundles and factors affecting their adoption, using primary data obtained from a survey of California avocado growers at the height of the drought during 2012\textendash 2013. Results show that farm location, share of income from agricultural production, use of cooperative extension advice, and farmer characteristics, such as age and education, all play important roles in grower adoption of individual and bundled methods to adapt to water scarcity.},

Trees exhibited typical alternate bearing patterns with heavy and light crop loads ("on" and "off" years, respectively) alternating from year to year. Shoot growth occurred during two distinct flushes each year, one in spring and one in late summer. Although yield varied among rootstocks, neither the rate of shoot growth during flushes nor the total cumulative shoot growth over a season differed among rootstocks. However, cumulative shoot growth was 35 times higher in 1993, when yield was almost nil, as compared to other years. The spring growth flush accounted for the majority of total shoot growth in most years; however, the summer growth flush accounted for more of the total shoot growth during 1993. Root growth did not exhibit dormant periods as shoot growth did, but in general, root growth was greatest when shoots were not actively growing. Crop load did not appear to affect root growth patterns or intensity. Bloom occurred each year from mid-March to mid-May. Bloom did not differ among rootstocks; however, bloom in "on" years occurred earlier and for a longer period than the bloom in "off" years. Shoot starch concentrations exhibited greater fluctuations during the year than trunk starch concentrations and were highest immediately before the onset of the spring shoot flush. This information gives us insight into the relative timing of and relationships between growth events of avocado in southern California and will help growers determine the optimal timing of cultural practices.},

  abstract = {Accurate pre-harvest estimation of avocado (Persea americana cv. Haas) yield offers a range of benefits to industry and growers. Currently there is no commercial yield monitor available for avocado tree crops and the manual count method used for yield forecasting can be highly inaccurate. Remote sensing using satellite imagery offers a potential means to achieve accurate pre-harvest yield forecasting. This study evaluated the accuracies of high resolution WorldView (WV) 2 and 3 satellite imagery and targeted field sampling for the pre-harvest prediction of total fruit weight (kg{$\cdot$}tree-1) and average fruit size (g) and for mapping the spatial distribution of these yield parameters across the orchard block. WV 2 satellite imagery was acquired over two avocado orchards during 2014, and WV3 imagery was acquired in 2016 and 2017 over these same two orchards plus an additional three orchards. Sample trees representing high, medium and low vigour zones were selected from normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the WV images and sampled for total fruit weight (kg{$\cdot$}tree-1) and average fruit size (g) per tree. For each sample tree, spectral reflectance data was extracted from the eight band multispectral WV imagery and 18 vegetation indices (VIs) derived. Principal component analysis (PCA) and non-linear regression analysis was applied to each of the derived VIs to determine the index with the strongest relationship to the measured total fruit weight and average fruit size. For all trees measured over the three year period (2014, 2016, and 2017) a consistent positive relationship was identified between the VI using near infrared band one and the red edge band (RENDVI1) to both total fruit weight (kg{$\cdot$}tree-1) (R2 = 0.45, 0.28, and 0.29 respectively) and average fruit size (g) (R2 = 0.56, 0.37, and 0.29 respectively) across all orchard blocks. Separate analysis of each orchard block produced higher R2 values as well as identifying different optimal VIs for each orchard block and year. This suggests orchard location and growing season are influencing the relationship of spectral reflectance to total fruit weight and average fruit size. Classified maps of avocado yield (kg{$\cdot$}tree-1) and average fruit size per tree (g) were produced using the relationships developed for each orchard block. Using the relationships derived between the measured yield parameters and the optimal VIs, total fruit yield (kg) was calculated for each of the five sampled blocks for the 2016 and 2017 seasons and compared to actual yield at time of harvest and pre-season grower estimates. Prediction accuracies achieved for each block far exceeded those provided by the grower estimates.},

To maintain and/or improve its productivity it is necessary to manage the orchards based on tree phenology. This study was undertaken to assess the occurrence and intensity of vegetative flushes (VF) in `Hass' avocado, as well as their importance on the production of floral shoots (FS) in various Michoac\'an climates. The study was conducted during two flowering cycles (2006-2008) in 14 commercial orchards located in six climates typical of the Michoac\'an region: 1) Warm subhumid, 2) Semiwarm subhumid (driest), 3) Semiwarm subhumid (wettest), 4) Semiwarm humid, 5) Temperate subhumid, and 6) Temperate humid. Ten trees were chosen in each orchard; five branches were randomly selected on each tree; and 15-20 shoots from the winter vegetative flush (WVF) -which occurs during or immediately after the major bloom, were tagged in each branch. The VF's that emerged subsequently were identified as well as their respective contributions to the production of FS. According to the season in which they emerged, there were three VF's: winter (November-February), spring (February-June) and summer (June-September). These VF's resulted in four flowering flushes: Crazy bloom (August-September), Advanced bloom (October-December), Normal bloom (DecemberFebruary) and March bloom (February-March). The type of climate affected the magnitude and intensity of VF's; however, in all climates, the WVF was the most important producer of FS. In general, Normal flowering was produced by winter shoots; Crazy and Advanced flowering by spring and summer shoots; March bloom by summer VF shoots.},

In particular, SE Spain (Granada and Malaga provinces) has irrigated avocado orchards spread widely along the Mediterranean coast, where several advantages related to favorable climate and location make Spain the only European avocado producer. However, limited water resources worsened by climate change exacerbate water scarcity and exert greater pressure on a territory under a dry Mediterranean climate, making further research urgent to boost water use efficiency. Therefore sustainable irrigation programs for this crop become key in this water shortage scenario, which needs the support of transfer and teaching as well as the collaboration of governmental institutions, irrigation associations, and farmers.},

This review places the past research and other international literature into context to highlight gaps in knowledge that should be addressed in order to improve the current water management of avocado orchards in South Africa. Research carried out during the 1990s established the current soil-based irrigation norms. However, soil measurements do not supply a direct indication of plant water status, creating a measure of uncertainty if irrigation is applied according to the needs of the tree. Stress was shown to have negative effects on plant performance, yield and post-harvest fruit quality. It is therefore important to revise the water requirement of avocado for the different production regions, as well as to determine the stress threshold levels. In addition, determining water requirements of young, non-bearing orchards is crucial as there are no guidelines for water management of young non-bearing trees.},

Apical buds (or expanding inflorescences) borne on summer shoots were collected weekly from July to August during an ``on'' and ``off'' crop year. Collected samples were externally described and microscopically analyzed. The transition from vegetative to reproductive condition probably occurred from the end of July through August (end of shoot expansion). During this transition the primary axis meristem changed shape from convex to flat to convex. These events were followed by the initiation of additional bracts and their associated secondary axis inflorescence meristems. A period of dormancy was not a prerequisite for inflorescence development. Continued production of secondary axis inflorescence meristems was observed from August to October, followed by anthesis seven months later. In all, eleven visual stages of bud development were distinguished and correlated with organogenesis to create a scale that can be used to predict specific stages of inflorescence and flower development. Inflorescence development was correlated with minimum temperature {$\leq$}15 \textdegree C, whereas yield had little effect on the timing of developmental events of individual inflorescence buds. However, the high yield of the ``on'' year reduced inflorescence number and increased the number of vegetative shoots. No determinate inflorescences were produced during the ``on'' year. For the ``off'' year, 3\% and 42\% of shoots produced determinate and indeterminate inflorescences, respectively.},

The objective of the study was to quantify the effects of GA3 canopy sprays applied to `Hass' avocado trees during the months preceding an ``off'' or ``on'' bloom on inflorescence and vegetative shoot number and yield. The experiment was initiated approximately seven months before an anticipated ``off'' bloom in an attempt to increase flowering intensity and yield. GA3 (25 or 100 mg{$\cdot$}L\textendash 1) was applied to separate sets of trees in September (early stage of inflorescence initiation), November (early stage of inflorescence development), January (initial development of the perianth of terminal flowers), March (cauliflower stage of inflorescence development; only 25 mg{$\cdot$}L\textendash 1), or monthly from September through January (only 25 mg{$\cdot$}L\textendash 1). Control trees did not receive any treatment. GA3 (100 mg{$\cdot$}L\textendash 1) applied in September reduced inflorescence number in both years, but not yield. GA3 (25 or 100 mg{$\cdot$}L\textendash 1) applied in November before the ``on'' bloom reduced inflorescence number with a concomitant increase in vegetative shoot number and 47\% yield reduction compared to control trees. This treatment might provide avocado growers with a tool to break the alternate bearing cycle by reducing yield in an expected ``on'' crop year to achieve a higher yield the following year. GA3 (25 mg{$\cdot$}L\textendash 1) applied in November or January stimulated early development of the vegetative shoot of indeterminate inflorescences. January and March applications did not affect the number of flowering or vegetative shoots produced either year. GA3 (25 mg{$\cdot$}L\textendash 1) applied in March at the start of an ``off'' bloom increased 2fold the production of commercially valuable fruit (213 to 269 g per fruit) compared to the control.},

Data trees were selected in two orchards based on their current crop load. Four to five branches per tree were tagged, and the number and intensity of vegetative flushes that developed during 2 years, as well as the type of growth produced by apical buds of shoots of different ages, were recorded at the end of the winter bloom periods for two separate years, 1999 and 2001. In a separate experiment using a different set of trees, winter and summer flush shoots were defoliated (year 1) or defoliated and girdled (year 2) at different stages of bud development from September to January in each case. Four vegetative flushes occurred each year. The winter flush that emerged in Feb. 1998 made the greatest contribution to the 1999 winter bloom\textemdash 76.5\% of the shoots produced floral shoots. Contributions of the summer 1 (late July 1998), summer 2 (early Aug. 1998), and summer 3 (late Aug. 1998) flushes to flowering were intermediate. A total of 30.6\%, 36.4\%, and 19\% of the shoots produced floral shoots respectively. All four vegetative flushes produced a similar number of vegetative shoots during winter bloom. Evaluation of the 2001 winter bloom for trees with high ({$>$}95 kg fruit/tree) and low ({$<$}70 kg fruit/tree) crops showed no effect of tree fruit load on the production of vegetative or floral shoots by winter or summer vegetative flushes. Irrespective of time of treatment (shoot defoliation and girdling) or shoot age, irreversible commitment to flowering of apical buds occurred by 15 Oct., and this stage was associated with an average of 27.5 chilling days (temperature, \#19 \textdegree C) for both years. Buds irreversibly committed to flowering were closed and pointed, with partial senescence of bud scales. Anatomically, the buds showed a convex primary axis meristem and four secondary axis floral shoot meristems.},

Floral development of `Hass' was related to ambient temperature and mathematically modeled. Floral development on shoots of the winter flush was correlated to chilling days accumulated (CDA) at temperatures {$\leq$} 21 \textdegree C, as well as the accumulated intervals between daily maximum and minimum temperatures (ACINT). In the case of summer flush shoots, they were associated to CDA with temperatures {$\leq$} 19 \textdegree C, {$\leq$} 20 \textdegree C and the ACINT. Two floral development prediction models ere obtained for winter shoots, winterCDA {$\leq$} 21 (R2 = 0.99) and winterACINT (R2 = 0.96).

  abstract = {Two experiments (Expts. 1 and 2) were conducted at different times with avocado (Persea americana Mill. cv. Choquette) trees in containers to test the effects of leaf pruning immediately after removing trees from short-term flooding on tree recovery. Trees in each experiment were divided into two flooding treatments: (1) flooded, or (2) non-flooded. Trees in each flooding treatment were divided into two pruning treatments: (1) pruned; approximately two-thirds of the canopy removed by pruning immediately after trees were removed from flooding (unflooded), or (2) non-pruned. In each experiment, net CO2 assimilation (A), stomatal conductance of water vapor (gs), transpiration (E), water use efficiency (WUE, calculated as A/E) and xylem sap flow (in Expt. 2) were determined daily during the flooding period and periodically after trees were unflooded until harvest time in each flooding/pruning treatment. Tissue dry weights were determined for trees in all treatments at the end of the experiment (several weeks after trees were unflooded). Net CO2 assimilation, gs, E and WUE of flooded trees decreased after 2 and 5 days and trees were unflooded after 3 and 6 days in Expts. 1 and 2, respectively. After trees were unflooded, A, gs, E and WUE were lower in flooded trees than in non-flooded trees for a few weeks, but these reductions were greater for pruned than non-pruned trees. Eventually, A, gs, E and WUE of flooded trees in both the pruned and non-pruned treatments returned to values similar to those of non-flooded trees. After trees were unflooded, for trees in the pruned treatment, xylem sap flow was generally not significantly affected by flooding. However, for non-pruned trees, xylem sap flow was usually lower in the flooded than nonflooded trees. In each experiment, leaf dry weight and total plant dry weight were significantly lower for flooded than non-flooded trees only in the non-pruned treatments. In Expt. 2, root and stem dry weights were also lower in flooded than non-flooded trees only in the non-pruned treatment. The results indicate that pruning the canopy of avocado immediately after trees are removed from short-term flooding hastens plant recovery. It is postulated that the hastened recovery was due to pruning bringing the shoot to root ratio of flooded trees (with damaged roots) and the subsequent supply and demand for water and nutrients into better equilibrium in flooded trees, allowing pruned trees to recover more quickly from flooding compared to non-pruned trees.},

Among the causes of poor crop yield, inadequate nutrient management is majorly considered apart from climate, cultivar, etc. The objective of the manuscript was to analyze the nutrient requirement of avocado under different growth stages and appropriate nutrient management practices for avocado. The nutrient requirement of the avocado may vary according to its seasonal growth pattern, soil conditions, cultivar type, and yield potential, etc. Therefore, synchronizing fertilizer nutrient supply on the basis of crop demand can improve fruit yield and quality, and enhance nutrient uptake, thereby reduction of nutrient losses could sustain the production system from the environmental degradation. The nutrient requirement of an avocado cultivar at different growth stages can be formulated based on periodic soil analysis, monitoring leaf nutrient concentration at different growth stages, and total nutrient removal by harvested fruits, and yield potential. Standardization of the best nutrient management practices will be useful in improving yield and quality of avocado and farm income.},

  abstract = {The performance of `Hass' avocado trees grown in lysimeters under different irrigation regimes obtained by manipulating drip irrigation frequency and root volume was examined. The experimental design comprised six treatments (3x2) with three irrigation frequencies and two container volumes (100- and 200-L). The three irrigation frequencies were: pulsed irrigation (10-20 min every 30 min) throughout the day (Irg1), one daily irrigation event started at night and terminated in the morning every day (Irg2) and one irrigation event every two days (Irg3). Irrigation managements induced significant differences in water availability in the root zone and subsequently, on the diurnal and periodical water uptake. The experimental treatments induced significant differences on fruitlet drops and accordingly, on fruit yield. Black spots initiated from the seed became apparent on some of the fruits at the beginning of June, and about two weeks later an intensive drop of fruitlet begun that ended at the beginning of July. The drop was more intense in the 100-L than the 200-L containers, followings the order Irg3{$>$}Irg2{$>>$}Irg1 in both cases. Net CO2 assimilation during periods of fruit growth decreased in trees exposed to moderate or severe water stress (Irg2 and Irg3, respectively) and therefore, it is plausible that fruitlet drop resulted from carbohydrates stress as suggested earlier. In addition, it is logical to assume that improvement of water and nutrient availability, especially in periods where the activity of the root system was weak as a result of low carbohydrates supply played a dominant role in seeds or fruit function.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Only a few phenological models have been formulated for rain-fed avocados in warm subhumid environments, and none of them have suggested crop management strategies for improving the trees performance in such conditions. The occurrence and intensity of major phenological events were assessed in 'Hass' and 'Margarida' avocado trees, in order to properly schedule the main crop practices for optimum management of rain-fed orchards in warm subhumid growing environments. Shoot growth, root density, number of open flowers, fruit set and fruit dropping rate were evaluated. For both cultivars, two shoot flushes were observed in September-October (spring) and January-February (summer), while a maximum feeder root growth took place in late August, coinciding with flowering. Two other minor root growth flushes occurred after the onset of summer rains. Both cultivars had only one flowering period, followed by an intense fruitlet dropping. A second minor fruit dropping wave occurred in February (mid-summer), for both cultivars. By determining the extent of each phenological phase in both avocado cultivars, it is possible to schedule applications of fertilizer, mulch and soil amendments, during the root growth flushes, as well as foliar sprays during shoot flushes, in order to maintain an adequate nutritional and sanitary status.           ,              RESUMO Poucos modelos fenol\'ogicos t\^em sido formulados para abacateiros cultivados em sequeiro, em ambientes sub\'umidos c\'alidos, e em nenhum deles foram sugeridas estrat\'egias de manejo do cultivo para melhorar o desempenho das \'arvores nessas condi\c{c}\~oes. Avaliou-se a ocorr\^encia e a intensidade dos principais eventos fenol\'ogicos em abacateiros 'Hass' e 'Margarida', visando a programar pr\'aticas culturais apropriadas para otimizar o manejo de pomares n\~ao irrigados, em ambiente c\'alido e sub\'umido. Foram avaliados o crescimento de brotos, densidade da raiz, n\'umero de flores abertas, frutos fixados e taxa de queda de frutos. Para ambas as cultivares, observaram-se dois fluxos de brota\c{c}\~ao em setembro-outubro (primavera) e janeiro-fevereiro (ver\~ao), enquanto o crescimento m\'aximo das ra\'izes de absor\c{c}\~ao ocorreu no final de agosto, coincidindo com o florescimento.

Soil fertility of the orchards was evaluated, as well as the quality of irrigation water, and the nutritional state of the leaves; sufficiency ranges were calculated, and the Deviation from Optimum Percentage method was used to interpret the results. Soils and the quality of irrigation water showed different chemical characteristics that had an influence on nutrient concentration in avocado leaves. The Deviation from Optimum Percentage (DOP) method allowed us to identify requirements of N, Zn, Mn, Fe and B in agrohabitat one, and deficiencies of P, K, Ca, S, Zn and Mn in agrohabitat two, which must be taken into account to implement a fertilization program in the studied orchards.},

Each cultivar had a characteristic form judged on tree height and diameter, and number, frequency and angle of inclination of major limbs. This form was related to differences between cultivars in the number and length distribution of axillary branches, and of the relative dominance of proleptic and sylleptic axillary shoots. These differences were apparently established by the interaction between apical dominance and apical control (acrotony). Cultivars `Fuerte', `Gwen' and `Reed' displayed weak apical dominance in that they produced large numbers of sylleptic shoots. They also displayed weak acrotony, producing few major limbs, relatively short axillary branching and few proleptic shoots. Cultivar `Sharwil' exhibited strong apical dominance with relatively few sylleptic shoots, but strong acrotonous growth with many major limbs, and long and numerous proleptic axillary shoots. Cultivar `Hass' was intermediate between `Sharwil' and `Reed' at the same location. Major differences in tree vigour and number of proleptic shoots were found between locations with `Hass', although the basic model of tree architecture was similar at both locations. The data are discussed in terms of the opportunities to manipulate tree growth to enhance fruiting efficiency.},

La amplia aceptaci\'on de Hass en casi todos los mercados mundiales ha fortalecido la demanda por frutos de piel negra y rugosa en relaci\'on con aquellos de c\'ascara verde y lisa[cita requerida]. La preferencia por frutos de estas caracter\'isticas ha cambiado dr\'asticamente las prioridades para el mejoramiento gen\'etico de la P. americana y de hecho muchas de las nuevas variedades de color verde han sido poco plantadas[cita requerida].

  abstract = {Background and Aims Functional\textendash structural plant (FSP) models have been widely used to understand the complex interactions between plant architecture and underlying developmental mechanisms. However, to obtain evidence that a model captures these mechanisms correctly, a clear distinction must be made between model outputs used for calibration and thus verification, and outputs used for validation. In pattern-oriented modelling (POM), multiple verification patterns are used as filters for rejecting unrealistic model structures and parameter combinations, while a second, independent set of patterns is used for validation. Methods To test the potential of POM for FSP modelling, a model of avocado (Persea americana `Hass') was developed. The model of shoot growth is based on a conceptual model, the annual growth module (AGM), and simulates photosynthesis and adaptive carbon allocation at the organ level. The model was first calibrated using a set of observed patterns from a published article. Then, for validation, model predictions were compared with a different set of empirical patterns from various field studies that were not used for calibration. Key Results After calibration, our model simultaneously reproduced multiple observed architectural patterns. The model then successfully predicted, without further calibration, the validation patterns. The model supports the hypothesis that carbon allocation can be modelled as being dependent on current organ biomass and sink strength of each organ type, and also predicted the observed developmental timing of the leaf sink\textendash source transition stage. Conclusions These findings suggest that POM can help to improve the `structural realism' of FSP models, i.e. the likelihood that a model reproduces observed patterns for the right reasons. Structural realism increases predictive power so that the response of an AGM to changing environmental conditions can be predicted. Accordingly, our FSP model provides a better but still parsimonious understanding of the mechanisms underlying known patterns of AGM growth.},

More typical yields in the cooler, semi-arid winter rainfall areas are 8 to 12 t ha-1. A target sustainable yield with current germplasm of 30 t ha-1 still appears realistic. The majority of growers average less than half of these yields.},

  abstract = {In the present work we will describe the primary results of dense orchards in which a very intensive concept for pruning and irrigation is being developed. The main stream of the concept is to control the tree volume by means of mechanical pruning and vegetative inhibition through the use of gibberellin synthesis inhibitors, producing compact trees (2,5 m high) with enough space between rows for good light not only in upper parts but also in those lower Another important point regarding this concept is to create narrow rows for reducing the internal volume of trees under poor light conditions and low yield. The trees are controlled for a maximum height of 2.5 meters, allowing the harvest to be performed from ground level thus avoiding additional costs as a result of high efficiency. In two different trials we have 800, 1,250 or 1,670 trees per hectare. Some of the treatments restrict root volume by using a plastic barrier in the soil. The yield of the second and third season after plantation ranges from 17 to 30 tones per hectare. The primary results indicate that root restriction improves irrigation efficiency and helps to control the growth of trees.},

This tool aims at assisting in the selection of appropriate shade trees taking into account local conditions as well as needs and preferences of smallholder farmers while maximizing ecosystem services from plot to landscape level. This user-friendly and practical tool provides site-specific recommendations on tree species selection via simple graphical displays and is targeted towards extension services and stakeholders directly involved in sustainable agroforestry and adaptation to climate change. The tool is based on a simple protocol to collect local agroforestry knowledge through farmers' interviews and rankings of tree species with respect to locally perceived key ecosystem services. The data collected are first analysed using the BradleyTerry2 package in R, yielding the ranking scores that are used in the decision-support tool. Originally developed for coffee and cocoa systems of Uganda and Ghana, this tool can be extended to other producing regions of the world as well as to other cropping systems. The tool will be tested to see if repeated assessments show consistent ranking scores, and to see if the use of the tool by extension workers improves their shade tree advice to local farmers.},

  abstract = {In spite of selection for thousands of years, the avocado is still a poorly domesticated tree in the early stages of adaptation to an orchard environment. Cultivars based on Guatemalan and Mexican germplasm, for the subtropics and Mediterranean climates, have only been available since the 1920's, and even in the best growing conditions the yield barrier of 30 t{$\cdot$}ha-1 is hard to breach. Tropical ``West Indian'' (lowland) avocado cultivars and production technology is less well developed. Orchard performance is therefore still largely influenced by evolutionary hangovers and constraints. For ``subtropical'' types, we have to deal with the residual survival strategies of a late-successional, K-selected, small-gap colonizing mountain cloud forest tree. These include potentially vigorous vegetative growth in flushes, counter-productive to flowering and fruiting; delayed and typically irregular (mast) fruiting; unnecessarily profuse flowering in late winter synchronized by winter cold and drought; short-lived shade-adapted leaves borne increasingly further from the trunk on the tree periphery; energy-expensive fruits for large dispersal agents, hence the exhaustive nature of cropping on reserves, especially in large trees; and the tree's strategy to efficiently hoard, store and recycle carbohydrate and mineral reserves (hence ``mineral-cheap'' fruiting). Physiological attributes include potentially rapid C assimilation, but reduced photosynthesis under shade, water of Phytophthora stress; reasonable drought tolerance which however is at the expense of C assimilation and leaf efficiency; and the poorly researched dependence on perseitol rather than sucrose as the main translocation sugar. Manipulation implications center around canopy/tree size/light management and the alleviation of stress at critical times, to optimize C gain and allocation to fruiting on a sustainable basis. The prime need remains breeding for more manageable scion and rootstock combinations.},

  abstract = {Alternate bearing (AB) and irregular bearing (IB) present major challenges to growers and marketers of avocados. This problem is common to most tree fruit crops, and varies in intensity, It can manifest countrywide, regionally, on a specific farm and even in the branches of a single tree. AB is typically initiated by an abnormally heavy or light crop in young trees, followed by a light or heavy subsequent crop. This pattern then becomes entrained and difficult to change unless severe climatic events intervene, or drastic management interventions are made. A heavy "on" crop results in reduced vegetative shoot and root flushing, and less carbohydrate (energy reserves) build-up. Seed gibberellins may also reduce flower bud initiation. Fewer flowering and fruiting sites for next season's cropping are formed, and flowering intensity is reduced. Many complex, interacting factors affect AB intensity. A brief discussion is given of remedial measures such as pruning, girdling, growth retardants and management intensification. In future, new cultivars and rootstocks will reduce AB intensity. In the interim, revised growth cycle charts reflecting "on" and "off crop seasons are helpful in managing AB.},

  abstract = {Vegetation metrics, such as leaf area (LA), leaf area density (LAD), and vertical leaf area profile, are essential measures of tree-scale biophysical processes associated with photosynthetic capacity, and canopy geometry. However, there are limited published investigations of their use for horticultural tree crops. This study evaluated the ability of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) for measuring LA, LAD, and vertical leaf area profile across two mango, macadamia and avocado trees using discrete return data from a RIEGL VZ-400 Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) system. These data were collected multiple times for individual trees to align with key growth stages, essential management practices, and following a severe storm. The first return of each laser pulse was extracted for each individual tree and classified as foliage or wood based on TLS point cloud geometry. LAD at a side length of 25 cm voxels, LA at the canopy level and vertical leaf area profile were calculated to analyse tree crown changes. These changes included: (1) pre-pruning vs. post-pruning for mango trees; (2) pre-pruning vs. post-pruning for macadamia trees; (3) pre-storm vs. post-storm for macadamia trees; and (4) tree leaf growth over a year for two young avocado trees. Decreases of 34.13 m2 and 8.34 m2 in LA of mango tree crowns occurred due to pruning. Pruning for the high vigour mango tree was mostly identified between 1.25 m and 3 m. Decreases of 38.03 m2 and 16.91 m2 in LA of a healthy and unhealthy macadamia tree occurred due to pruning. After flowering and spring flush of the same macadamia trees, storm effects caused a 9.65 m2 decrease in LA for the unhealthy tree, while an increase of 34.19 m2 occurred for the healthy tree. The tree height increased from 11.13 m to 11.66 m, and leaf loss was mainly observed between 1.5 m and 4.5 m for the unhealthy macadamia tree. Annual increases in LA of 82.59 m2 and 59.97 m2 were observed for two three-year-old avocado trees. Our results show that TLS is a useful tool to quantify changes in the LA, LAD, and vertical leaf area profiles of horticultural trees over time, which can be used as a general indicator of tree health, as well as assist growers with improved pruning, irrigation, and fertilisation application decisions.},

  abstract = {To support the adoption of precision agricultural practices in horticultural tree crops, prior research has investigated the relationship between crop vigour (height, canopy density, health) as measured by remote sensing technologies, to fruit quality, yield and pruning requirements. However, few studies have compared the accuracy of different remote sensing technologies for the estimation of tree height. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy, flexibility, aerial coverage and limitations of five techniques to measure the height of two types of horticultural tree crops, mango and avocado trees. Canopy height estimates from Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) were used as a reference dataset against height estimates from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data, WorldView-3 (WV-3) stereo imagery, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based RGB and multi-spectral imagery, and field measurements. Overall, imagery obtained from the UAV platform were found to provide tree height measurement comparable to that from the TLS (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.19 m and rRMSE = 5.37 \% for mango trees; R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.42 m and rRMSE = 4.75 \% for avocado trees), although coverage area is limited to 1\textendash 10 km2 due to battery life and line-of-sight flight regulations. The ALS data also achieved reasonable accuracy for both mango and avocado trees (R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 0.24 m and rRMSE = 7.39 \% for mango trees; R2 = 0.63, RMSE = 0.43 m and rRMSE = 5.04 \% for avocado trees), providing both optimal point density and flight altitude, and therefore offers an effective platform for large areas (10 km2\textendash 100 km2). However, cost and availability of ALS data is a consideration. WV-3 stereo imagery produced the lowest accuracies for both tree crops (R2 = 0.50, RMSE = 0.84 m and rRMSE = 32.64 \% for mango trees; R2 = 0.45, RMSE = 0.74 m and rRMSE = 8.51 \% for avocado trees) when compared to other remote sensing platforms, but may still present a viable option due to cost and commercial availability when large area coverage is required. This research provides industries and growers with valuable information on how to select the most appropriate approach and the optimal parameters for each remote sensing platform to assess canopy height for mango and avocado trees.},
