  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for information about the economic impact of agricultural carbon (C) sequestration in the developing world, but as yet no studies have assessed the potential for farmers in the highland tropics to participate in C contracts. In this paper we show how an econometric-process simulation model, designed to simulate the value of terrace and agroforestry investments, can be used to assess the economic feasibility of C sequestration. We use this model to simulate the impact of C contracts on the adoption of terraces and agroforestry practices in the highlands of northern Peru. The analysis shows that participation in C contracts could increase adoption of terraces and agroforestry practices, with the rate of adoption depending on the C accumulation rate and key factors affecting terrace productivity such as field slope. The simulation results show there is a relatively low economic potential for C sequestration in this agricultural system at C prices below \$50 per MgC, but that potential increases substantially for C prices above \$50 per MgC. Under favorable conditions for C sequestration and a C price of \$100 per MgC, terrace and agroforesty adoption and C sequestration have the potential to raise per capita incomes by up to 15\% on farms with steeply sloped fields, and reduce poverty by as much as 9\%.},

  abstract = {Streamflow simulation across the tropics is limited by the lack of data to calibrate and validate large-scale 15 hydrological models. Here, we applied the process-based, conceptual HYPE (Hydrological Predictions for the Environment) model to quantitively assess Costa Rica's water resources at a national scale. Data scarcity was compensated using adjusted global topography and remotely-sensed climate products to force, calibrate, and independently evaluate the model. We used a global temperature product and bias-corrected precipitation from CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data) as model forcings. Daily streamflow from 13 gauges for the period 1990-2003 and monthly MODIS 20 (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) potential evapotranspiration (PET) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) for the period 2000-2014 were used to calibrate and evaluate the model applying four different model configurations. The calibration consisted in step-wise parameter constraints preserving the best parameter sets from previous simulations in an attempt to balance the variable data availability and time periods. The model configurations were independently evaluated using hydrological signatures such as the baseflow index, runoff coefficient, and aridity index, among others. Results suggested 25 that a two-step calibration using monthly and daily streamflow was a better option instead of calibrating only with daily streamflow. Additionally, including PET and AET in the calibration improved the simulated water balance and better matched hydrological signatures. Thus, the constrained parameter uncertainty increased the confidence in the simulation results. Such a large-scale hydrological model has the potential to be used operationally across the humid tropics informing decision making at relatively high spatial and temporal resolution.},

  abstract = {The Mesoamerican region is considered to be one of the areas in the world most vulnerable to climate change. We developed a framework for quantifying the vulnerability of the livelihoods of coffee growers in Mesoamerica at regional and local levels and identify adaptation strategies. Following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concepts, vulnerability was defined as the combination of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. To quantify exposure, changes in the climatic suitability for coffee and other crops were predicted through niche modelling based on historical climate data and locations of coffee growing areas from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Future climate projections were generated from 19 Global Circulation Models. Focus groups were used to identify nine indicators of sensitivity and eleven indicators of adaptive capacity, which were evaluated through semi-structured interviews with 558 coffee producers. Exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were then condensed into an index of vulnerability, and adaptation strategies were identified in participatory workshops. Models predict that all target countries will experience a decrease in climatic suitability for growing Arabica coffee, with highest suitability loss for El Salvador and lowest loss for Mexico. High vulnerability resulted from loss in climatic suitability for coffee production and high sensitivity through variability of yields and out-migration of the work force. This was combined with low adaptation capacity as evidenced by poor post harvest infrastructure and in some cases poor access to credit and low levels of social organization. Nevertheless, the specific contributors to vulnerability varied strongly among countries, municipalities and families making general trends difficult to identify. Flexible strategies for adaption are therefore needed. Families need the support of government and institutions specialized in impacts of climate change and strengthening of farmer organizations to enable the adjustment of adaptation strategies to local needs and conditions.},

  abstract = {Agroforestry systems usually include a high density and diversity of shade trees. Such systems often have a large diversity of fauna and flora and provide local and regional ecosystem services. Shade trees are, however, being removed to increase crop production in many tropical regions. There is little knowledge on the effect of shade trees on crop production in the context of trade-offs with other management practices. We therefore compared the benefits of exotic versus native shade trees on coffee production. We evaluated the importance of shade tree management for crop production in the context of management practices. Management practices included fertilization, liming, coffee pruning, weeding, and irrigation in 113 coffee agroforests in Kodagu, India, over a wide range of shade tree density, tree species diversity, and shade cover. We studied, in particular, Grevillea and non-Grevillea shade trees, the latter including mostly native tree species. Results show that a rise of 100 non-Grevillea shade tree per hectare increased production of berries by 5.6~\% and larger beans by 6.25~\%. Irrigation and liming increased berry production respectively by 16 and 20~\%. These management interventions are likely to offset the relatively small negative effect of reducing shade density of non-Grevillea trees on coffee production. Recommendations based on an understanding of shade tree management alone can be misleading with regard to crop production.},

  abstract = {Production of coffee, especially by small holders, is often associated with various forms of shade management. To analyse the effects of shade on physical coffee quality and on sensorial cup quality of Coffea arabica L. cv. Caturra KMC, a study was carried out with 94 plots on 16 farms in two municipalities, Timana\textasciiacute{} and Oporapa, located at elevations from 1272 to 1730 masl. in Huila, Colombia. The study was designed with emphasis on shade cover variation within each of the two study areas, while minimizing the variability of environment, agronomic management other than shade, and post-harvest processing. 46 samples of shade coffee and 46 samples of sun coffee were evaluated for physical and sensorial attributes using three professional coffee cuppers (assessors). A principal component analysis including all quality and environmental variables showed that sensory attributes were influenced negatively by shade, and that physical attributes were influenced positively by altitude. A mixed linear model, with coffee cupper and farm as random variables, revealed different shade effects on coffee quality in the two areas. In Oporapa, situated at high altitudes, shade had a negative effect on fragrance, acidity, body, sweetness and preference of the beverage, while no effect was found on the physical quality. In Timana\textasciiacute{} , situated at lower altitudes, shade did not have a significant effect on sensorial attributes, but significantly reduced the number of small beans. At high altitudes with low temperatures and no nutrient or water deficits, shade trees may thus have a partly adverse effect on C. arabica cv. Caturra resulting in reduced sensory quality. The occurrence of berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) was lower at high altitudes and higher under shade. Future studies on shade and coffee quality should focus on the interaction between physical and chemical characteristics of beans.},

Rainfall interception, transpiration, runoff and soil water content were monitored during 3 years. Runoff was lower in AFS than MC (5.4 and 8.4\% of total rainfall, respectively) and a higher water infiltration was observed under AFS. Still, the higher combined rainfall interception + transpiration of coffee and shade trees in AFS resulted in a lower drainage than in MC. No coffee water stress was recorded either in AFS or MC as relative extractable soil water remained above 20\% during the dry seasons. Time course of soil water content showed enhanced access to soil water between 100 and 200 cm depth in AFS. This suggests complementarity for soil water between coffee and shade trees. The model HYDRUS 1D predicted that drainage at 200 cm depth accounted for a large fraction of annual rainfall (68\% for MC and 62\% for AFS). Climatic scenario simulations showed (1) a potential competition for water between coffee and shade trees when the dry season was extended by 4\textendash 6 weeks compared to actual, and (2) a severe reduction in annual drainage, but without competition for water when rainfall was reduced down to 40\% of the actual.},

  abstract = {Deforestation causes soil erosion, especially in the humid tropics where rainfall is heavy and terrain is often steep. Landuses, such as overgrazing and planting annual crops on slopes exacerbate the resultant land degradation. Consequent loss of productivity in this area of the world is on a collision course with increasing human population density and the demand for food. Because of the serious nature of erosion, its effects on tropical soil, especially biological characteristics that help reestablish soil fertility, need more study. Here, we used apparent erosion intensity, land-use history, and soil color to \textregistered nd eight sites representing an a priori spatial gradient of soil degradation on an overgrazed Costa Rican farm. We tested the gradient by measuring several chemical factors that indicate fertility of these tropical Ultisols. These factors decreased with increasing degree of soil degradation. Next, we assessed spore density and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) along the gradient. We found that the diversity and composition of AMF changed across the gradient although not in the same pattern as the chemical factors. Finally, three years of vegetative regeneration after cattle exclusion had not improved the soils chemically but some improvement in AMF status was suggested for the less damaged sites. These results show that local farmers can use common sense cues to determine the chemical and biological status of their soils, that they can use these cues in future land-use decisions, such as planting hardy trees in the most degraded sites, and that they must expect severely degraded sites to require many years for recuperation. It is possible that intervention to improve the AMF status of soils could hasten recovery, since this process seems to be the \textregistered rst to occur. \# 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Wood biophysical properties and the dynamics of water storage discharge and refilling were studied in the trunk of canopy tree species with diverse life history and functional traits in subtropical forests of northeast Argentina. Multiple techniques assessing capacitance and storage capacity were used simultaneously to improve our understanding of the functional significance of internal water sources in trunks of large trees. Sapwood capacitances of 10 tree species were characterized using pressure\textendash volume relationships of sapwood samples obtained from the trunk. Frequency domain reflectometry was used to continuously monitor the volumetric water content in the main stems. Simultaneous sap flow measurements on branches and at the base of the tree trunk, as well as diurnal variations in trunk contraction and expansion, were used as additional measures of stem water storage use and refilling dynamics. All evidence indicates that tree trunk internal water storage contributes from 6 to 28\% of the daily water budget of large trees depending on the species. The contribution of stored water in stems of trees to total daily transpiration was greater for deciduous species, which exhibited higher capacitance and lower sapwood density. A linear relationship across species was observed between wood density and growth rates with the higher wood density species (mostly evergreen) associated with lower growth rates and the lower wood density species (mostly deciduous) associated with higher growth rates. The large sapwood capacitance in deciduous species may help to avoid catastrophic embolism in xylem conduits. This may be a low-cost adaptation to avoid water deficits during peak water use at midday and under temporary drought periods and will contribute to higher growth rates in deciduous tree species compared with evergreen ones. Large capacitance appears to have a central role in the rapid growth patterns of deciduous species facilitating rapid canopy access as these species are less shade tolerant than evergreen species.},

  abstract = {Agroforestry systems provide diverse ecosystem services that contribute to farmer livelihoods and the conservation of natural resources. Despite these known benefits, there is still limited understanding on how shade trees affect the provision of multiple ecosystem services at the same time and the potential trade-offs or synergies among them. To fill this knowledge gap, we quantified four major ecosystem services (regulation of pests and diseases; provisioning of agroforestry products; maintenance of soil fertility; and carbon sequestration) in 69 coffee agroecosystems belonging to smallholder farmers under a range of altitudes (as representative of environmental conditions) and management conditions, in the region of Turrialba, Costa Rica. We first analyzed the individual effects of altitude, types of shade and management intensity and their interactions on the provision of ecosystem services. In order to identify potential trade-offs and synergies, we then analyzed bivariate relationships between different ecosystem services, and between individual ecosystem services and plant biodiversity. We also explored which types of shade provided better levels of ecosystem services. The effectiveness of different types of shade in providing ecosystem services depended on their interactions with altitude and coffee management, with different ecosystem services responding differently to these factors. No trade-offs were found among the different ecosystem services studied or between ecosystem services and biodiversity, suggesting that it is possible to increase the provision of multiple ecosystem services at the same time. Overall, both low and highly diversified coffee agroforestry systems had better ability to provide ecosystem services than coffee monocultures in full sun. Based on our findings, we suggest that coffee agroforestry systems should be designed with diversified, productive shade canopies and managed with a medium intensity of cropping practices, with the aim of ensuring the continued provision of multiple ecosystem services. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There is relatively abundant information on ecosystem services provision within agroforestry systems, but comparatively scant information regarding how coffee farmers manage their plantations, the factors influencing their farming practices and the extent to which farmers' local knowledge \textendash{} as opposed to global scientific understanding \textendash{} underpins management decisions. Policymakers and scientists too frequently design development programs and projects in the coffee sector. On occasion technicians are included in the design process, but farmers and their knowledge are always excluded. This research explores farmers' knowledge regarding how trees affect coffee productivity and ecosystem services in Costa Rica. Farmers' knowledge on the effects of trees on coffee productivity was compared with that of other knowledge sources: coffee processors, technicians and scientists. Farmers were shown to have detailed knowledge regarding ecosystem services that their coffee agroforestry systems provide as well as on the interactions between trees and coffee productivity. When asked on the services that trees provide, farmers classified trees according to water protection, soil formation, or contribution to biodiversity conservation. These classifications were related to tree attributes such as leaf size, biomass production or root abundance. Comparison of coffee productivity knowledge from different knowledge sources revealed considerable complementarity and little contradiction.},

  abstract = {The assessment of crop yield losses is needed for the improvement of production systems that contribute to the incomes of rural families and food security worldwide. However, efforts to quantify yield losses and identify their causes are still limited, especially for perennial crops. Our objectives were to quantify primary yield losses (incurred in the current year of production) and secondary yield losses (resulting from negative impacts of the previous year) of coffee due to pests and diseases, and to identify the most important predictors of coffee yields and yield losses. We established an experimental coffee parcel with full-sun exposure that consisted of six treatments, which were defined as different sequences of pesticide applications. The trial lasted three years (2013\textendash 2015) and yield components, dead productive branches, and foliar pests and diseases were assessed as predictors of yield. First, we calculated yield losses by comparing actual yields of specific treatments with the estimated attainable yield obtained in plots which always had chemical protection. Second, we used structural equation modeling to identify the most important predictors. Results showed that pests and diseases led to high primary yield losses (26\%) and even higher secondary yield losses (38\%). We identified the fruiting nodes and the dead productive branches as the most important and useful predictors of yields and yield losses. These predictors could be added in existing mechanistic models of coffee, or can be used to develop new linear mixed models to estimate yield losses. Estimated yield losses can then be related to production factors to identify corrective actions that farmers can implement to reduce losses. The experimental and modeling approaches of this study could also be applied in other perennial crops to assess yield losses.},

  abstract = {Diurnal and seasonal tree water storage was studied in three large Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) trees at the Wind River Canopy Crane Research site. Changes in water storage were based on measurements of sap flow and changes in stem volume and tissue water content at different heights in the stem and branches. We measured sap flow by two variants of the heat balance method (with internal heating in stems and external heating in branches), stem volume with electronic dendrometers, and tissue water content gravimetrically. Water storage was calculated from the differences in diurnal courses of sap flow at different heights and their integration. Old-growth Douglas-fir trees contained large amounts of free water: stem sapwood was the most important storage site, followed by stem phloem, branch sapwood, branch phloem and needles. There were significant time shifts (minutes to hours) between sap flow measured at different positions within the transport system (i.e., stem base to shoot tip), suggesting a highly elastic transport system. On selected fine days between late July and early October, when daily transpiration ranged from 150 to 300 liters, the quantity of stored water used daily ranged from 25 to 55 liters, i.e., about 20\% of daily total sap flow. The greatest amount of this stored water came from the lower stem; however, proportionally more water was removed from the upper parts of the tree relative to their water storage capacity. In addition to lags in sap flow from one point in the hydrolic pathway to another, the withdrawal and replacement of stored water was reflected in changes in stem volume. When point-to-point lags in sap flow (minutes to hours near the top and stem base, respectively) were considered, there was a strong linear relationship between stem volume changes and transpiration. Volume changes of the whole tree were small (equivalent to 14\% of the total daily use of stored water) indicating that most stored water came from the stem and from its inelastic (sapwood) tissues. Whole tree transpiration can be maintained with stored water for about a week, but it can be maintained with stored water from the upper crown alone for no more than a few hours.},

  abstract = {Coffee is one of the most important tropical crops on earth, considering both its gross production value and the number of families that depend on it for their livelihoods. Coffee also grows within some of the world's most biodiverse habitats, in areas predicted to experience severe climate change impacts. Like many other crops, coffee benefits from several ecosystem services (ES) that provide important inputs or conditions for production. Given coffee's strong interactions with conservation, livelihoods, and climate change, it is important to understand the roles of biodiversity-regulated ES to coffee and how they are likely to change under future climates. Here we review the available literature on the provision of two essential and interacting ES that regulate coffee production: control of a beetle pest by birds and pollination by bees. Studies show that bird and bee communities provide pest control and pollination services that improve coffee quantity and quality, benefiting coffee farmers whose livelihoods depend on this crop. The literature also shows that a variety of plot, farm, and landscape management practices that support resources for bees and birds can enhance these ES. We also evaluate how these ES and their interactions may change under future climate change. Several studies have estimated likely climate impacts on coffee per se, but few have investigated climate vulnerability of pollination and pest control ES. Even less studies have quantified interactions between these ES. Although evidence is incomplete, managing coffee farms as diversified agroforestry systems could improve climate resilience of coffee cropping and communities of birds and bees, and therefore help farming families adapt to their changing environment. Based on our review, we identify six critical research priorities in this active area of study. Filling knowledge gaps would advance our understanding of interactions among landscapes, ES, and climate change, and would support climate adaptation for the millions of households whose livelihoods depend on coffee.},

Continued population growth has led to the intensified cultivation of large areas of the sloping lands, exacerbating the problem of soil erosion.

The Framework for Evaluating Sustainable Land Management (FESLM) has been tested in sloping land areas in the Philippines. Sustainable land management must be productive, stable, viable, and acceptable to farmers, while protecting soil and water resources. Farms on which contour hedgerow intercropping has been adopted meet the multifaceted requirements of FESLM, whereas the farmers' current practice does not. Appropriate land management measures for particular locations depend on a complex suite of social, economic, and biophysical factors, and need to be developed in participation with farmers.},

Animals that consumed supplements and weeds at the coffee plantation had the highest daily weight gain (112.75 g). Analysis of the coffee farm considering the three existing groups (without sheep, with sheep without supplements and with sheep with supplements) presented a positive return rate, with the coffee-sheep-supplement being the best option in terms of economic, agricultural and environmental benefits as a whole, although the return rate was lower. It is concluded that the productive response of sheep obtained with a small amount of supplements (70 g/animal/day) while feeding on weeds was superior to that of animals grazing in pastures of established grasses, even when they received the same dose of supplements. Therefore it is suggested that keeping herds of sheep grazing on weeds in coffee plantations is economically profitable as well as agronomically and environmentally beneficial.},

  abstract = {Agroforestry has been proposed as a way to reconcile biodiversity conservation, food production and the delivery of other ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. One such a key ecosystem service, especially in the light of climate change mitigation, is carbon storage. Increasing human disturbance and management intensification, however, are known to affect the carbon storage potential of forests. Here we assessed how the above- and belowground carbon stocks in Ethiopian moist evergreen Afromontane forest co-varied with their biodiversity, and with increasing agroforestry management intensity for the production of Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica L.). We assessed above- and belowground carbon storage in 60 plots across a gradient of agricultural intensification ranging from natural forest, over two different coffee agroforestry systems, to intensified shade plantations. We quantified the diversity of ground beetles and woody plants in the same plots. Carbon stocks in natural forests (413 \AE{} 55.6 S.E. Mg ha\`A1) and in the most extensively managed agroforestry systems (387 \AE{} 50.0 Mg ha\`A1) were significantly higher than those in the more intensified agroforest system (258 \AE{} 39.4 Mg ha\`A1) and in shade plantations (219 \AE{} 22.8 Mg ha\`A1). Diversity of woody plants, but not of ground beetles, declined with increasing management intensity and decreasing carbon stocks. Overall, this study demonstrates that extensive coffee farming in Ethiopian moist Afromontane forests is able to deliver important co-benefits in terms of woody plant species conservation and carbon storage. Given the associated coffee yield cost, it is most likely, however, that supporting payments from certification or policy mechanisms such as REDD+ are required to keep these extensive coffee agroforestry systems economically viable, which is required to avoid management intensification and associated carbon and biodiversity losses.},

Erosion control and pest control did not change over time. Coffee yield tended to decrease as the shade trees matured, but this was not significant. We found consistent positive relationships between carbon stock, erosion control and epiphyte richness. A trade-off between aboveground carbon stock and coffee yield was found for the first 10 years, while a positive relation between coffee yield and erosion control was found for the long term (10\textendash 20 years). Canopy cover best explained ecosystem service supply, but also farm agrochemical input management, altitude and slope influenced the supply.

The authors' models show that for the three most important grain crops\textemdash wheat, rice, and maize\textemdash yield lost to insects will increase by 10 to 25\% per degree Celsius of warming, hitting hardest in the temperate zone. These findings provide an estimate of further potential climate impacts on global food supply and a benchmark for future regional and field-specific studies of crop-pest-climate interactions. Science, this issue p. 916; see also p. 846 Insect pests substantially reduce yields of three staple grains\textemdash rice, maize, and wheat\textemdash but models assessing the agricultural impacts of global warming rarely consider crop losses to insects. We use established relationships between temperature and the population growth and metabolic rates of insects to estimate how and where climate warming will augment losses of rice, maize, and wheat to insects. Global yield losses of these grains are projected to increase by 10 to 25\% per degree of global mean surface warming. Crop losses will be most acute in areas where warming increases both population growth and metabolic rates of insects. These conditions are centered primarily in temperate regions, where most grain is produced.

We aimed to examine coffee varieties, shade, age of coffee plants, coffee plant density and soil properties in relation to CLR infection. To do this, we established a total of 75 plots in three agroforestry coffee plantations in the central Peruvian Amazon. We gathered data there in 2011 (dry season) on the presence/absence of CLR; coffee variety; age and density of coffee plants, and also took hemispherical photographs to determine canopy openness. In 2014 (wet season), we again gathered data on the same variables. In 2012, we collected soil samples from a subset of the plots. At all plantations, coffee variety had a significant effect on CLR incidence, with the Catimor variety infected less frequently than Caturra. Coffee plant age had a significant positive effect on CLR incidence. Increasing coffee density also increased CLR incidence for some of the studied plantations/seasons. Comparing those plots from which data were collected in the dry and wet seasons, we found that CLR presence was significantly higher in the wet season. The effect of shade on CLR incidence was not clear. Catimor and Caturra varieties showed opposite trends of CLR incidence in response to shade quantity in most cases (Caturra variety CLR incidence was decreasing with shading increase and Catimor CLR incidence decreasing with decreasing shading). Finally, the soil properties did not affect CLR incidence.},

We conclude that Vietnam could increase the emission pledges in its NDC, especially in future land use. Other options for mitigation at negative cost include water techniques in rice, agroforestry and management of livestock diets and manure. The MAC curve alone is insufficient to prioritize policy options for climate change policy, however, because it underestimates adaptation co-benefits, for example, in protected mangrove systems},

The results showed the existence of variability for almost all of the evaluated characteristics, with considerable influence of the genotypic effect.

However, research is often limited to the dichotomous analysis of shaded agroforestry systems or unshaded monocultures, often overlooking the nuanced effect of shade tree trait diversity. Our study aims to determine the cumulative effects of shade tree canopy architectural characteristics and leaf functional traits in biodiverse agroforests on microclimate modifications and CLR incidence. We measured plot-level microclimate conditions (air temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness duration, throughfall kinetic energy) in three single-stratum and two double-strata shade tree canopy treatments, including Erythrina poeppigiana, Terminalia amazonia, and Chloroleucon eurycyclum. Commonly reported canopy characteristics and leaf traits were compared to average microclimate conditions and CLR incidence levels. We found that shade tree trait expression significantly explained most microclimate conditions, and that two key shade tree traits (canopy openness, leaf area) significantly explain CLR incidence levels (R2 = 0.211, p = 0.036). Our results highlight the differences in microclimate conditions and CLR incidence among biodiverse agroforests, as well as the important explanatory power of shade tree traits. Specific effects of shade tree traits on pathogen dynamics can directly inform agroforestry system design (i.e., shade tree species selection) and sustainable coffee farm management practices (i.e., pruning practices).},

Thus, it is urgent to adopt pliable strategies to reduce and/or mitigate possible adverse effects to meet the growing demand for sustainable and resilient food production. Monoculture cropping is globally the most common production system. However, adaptation to ongoing climate change, namely, to more extreme environmental conditions, has renewed the interest in other practices such as agroforestry, agroecology, and permaculture. This article provides an overview of ecological and physiological interactions between trees and crops in Mediterranean agroforestry systems and compares them with those from monocultures. The advantages and disadvantages of both systems are explored. The added value of modeling in understanding the complexity of interactions within agroforestry systems, supporting decision-making under current and future weather conditions, is also pinpointed. Several interactions between trees and crops might occur in agroforestry systems, leading to mutual positive and/or negative effects on growth, physiology, and yield. In this sense, selecting the most suitable combination of tree/crop species in mixtures may be best be indicated by complementary traits, which are crucial to maximizing trade-offs, improving productivity, ecosystem services, and environmental sustainability.},

The objectives of this research were to develop agroforestry species recommendations and tailor these to the farmers' needs and local context, taking into consideration gender. Local knowledge of agroforestry species and ES preferences was collected through farmer interviews and rankings. Using the Bradley-Terry approach, analysis was done along an altitudinal gradient in order to study different climate change scenarios for coffee suitability. Farmers had different needs in terms of ES and tree species at different altitudes, e.g. at low altitude they need a relatively larger set of ES to sustain their coffee production and livelihood. Local knowledge is found to be gender blind as no differences were observed in the rankings of species and ES by men and women. Ranking species by ES and ranking ES by preference is a useful method to help scientists and extension agents to use local knowledge for the development of recommendations on companion trees in AFS for smallholder farmers.},

We analyzed the effects of landscape composition (amount of surrounding forest cover) and farm management (conventional vs. organic) on the diversity and structure of woody plant species assemblages in Costa Rican coffee agroforestry systems. We utilized information from a GIS land-use database, surveys of 1-ha plots located in 14 coffee farms and 4 forest fragments, and farmer interviews on management practices. The coffee farms harbored over 100 tree species, including 19\% of the native tree species found in the surrounding forests. The majority of tree species on the farms were native (82\%) to the study area and originated from natural regeneration (73\%). Among the tree species that regenerated naturally, 71\% were dispersed by animals. On the other hand more than half of the individuals were non-natives (55\%) and originated from planting, which resulted in low species similarity between farms and forests and a low density for most native species on the farms. Forest cover within a 1000 m radius around the farms varied between 4 and 38\%. Increasing forest cover around the farms had a significant, positive effect on species richness; especially on tree species dispersed by animals, and on species similarity between farms and forests. This suggests that the connection to natural forests increases seed dispersal into adjacent farms. The number of regenerated species was higher on the organic farms, but tree species richness was not affected by management type. Although species assemblages on the coffee farms are strongly determined by natural regeneration, the number of individuals contributed by these processes is low. Tree species conservation in agricultural landscapes would greatly benefit from protecting remnant forests, from facilitating natural regeneration processes and promoting native trees on farms, with particular attention to rare species.},

Research is needed on how to balance the competition from shade trees with the provision of ecological services to the coffee. In 2000, long-term coffee experiments were established in Costa Rica and Nicaragua to compare coffee agroecosystem performance under full sun, legume and non-legume shade types, and intensive and moderate conventional and organic inputs. Coffee yield from intensive organic production was not significantly different from intensive conventional in Nicaragua, but in Costa Rica it was lower during three of the six harvests. Full sun coffee production over 6~years was greater than shaded coffee in Costa Rica (61.8 vs. 44.7~t~ha-1, P~=~0.0002). In Nicaragua, full sun coffee production over 5~years (32.1~t~ha-1) was equal to coffee with shade that included Tabebuia rosea (Bertol.) DC., (27\textendash 30~t~ha-1) and both were more productive (P~=~0.03) than coffee shaded with Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd. (21.6~t~ha-1). Moderate input organic production was significantly lower than other managements under all shade types, except in the presence of Erythrina poepiggina (Walp.) O.F. Cook. Inga and Erythrina had greater basal area and nutrient recycling from prunings than other shade species. Intensive organic production increased soil pH and P, and had higher K compared to moderate conventional. Although legume shade trees potentially provide ecological services to associated coffee, this depends on management of the competition from those same trees.},

While some studies find unshaded intensively managed coffee is the most productive, other studies find no trade-off between shade characteristics and productivity. Our study of 179 farms from the main coffee growing regions of Costa Rica and Guatemala analyzed how shade affected the productive response of coffee to intensification of agronomic management. Four levels of coffee productivity were differentiated for each country associated with three levels of shade development in Costa Rica and two levels in Guatemala. The highest coffee productivity group was associated with medium shade development in both countries. High shade groups had low productivity, but very low productivity groups were associated with low (Costa Rica) or medium (Guatemala) shade. Medium and high productivity farms were associated with high elevation, lower rainfall and regions with higher coffee prices. Yields with a moderate level of investment (720\textendash 1,500 USD-1) and with medium shade (LAI 0.55-1.1) were not significantly different from yields with higher investment or lower shade levels. The increase in yields with increasing N fertilizer application were similar under low, medium and high LAI, but the mean productivity significantly lower with high LAI. Agronomic intensification to increase productivity is equally effective for low and medium shade systems (LAI {$<$}1.1); low productivity farms may have high shade or low shade but are mainly limited by low investment. Intensification of production is compatible with medium shade levels that should deliver broader ecosystem services but achieving this depends on coffee prices enabling this investment.},

  abstract = {A synthesis of a five year research program on nitrogen (N) cycling in coffee plantations in Costa Rica is presented. In the main areas where coffee is grown, full sun coffee plantations were compared with coffee agroforestry systems in order to improve N fertilization and shade management to optimize the production of coffee and associated trees while reducing nitrate (NO3 -) leaching to ground water and N2O emissions. Costa Rican coffee soils exhibited: (1) high permeability allowing large water drainage; but (2) different adsorption patterns resulting in different NO3 - dynamics. Acrisols (Ultisols, USDA classification) presented a dominance of positive charges in the subsoil which were responsible for NO3 - adsorption and mitigated NO3 - leaching and groundwater contamination. On the other hand, andisols from the Central Valley did not retain NO3 - so that NO3 - was leached to the aquifers. In a full sun coffee plantation, fertilization experiments showed that increasing the N fertilizer level from 150 to 350 kg N ha-1 yr-1 resulted in a low additional coffee production and a high potential for NO3 - water contamination. In optimum growing conditions for coffee in full sunlight and high fertilization, the inclusion of shade trees (Eucalyptus deglupta or Inga densiflora) increased N accumulation in litter and permanent biomass and slightly reduced water drainage, but also reduced coffee production by 25-33\%. In these conditions, the effect of the shade tree on NO3 - leaching varied according to coffee production. Additionally, in a highly fertilized coffee-Inga densiflora association (250 kg N ha-1 y-1), the use of 15N labelled fertilizer showed a low efficiency of N fertilizer for both coffee and tree production. In a full sun coffee plot, where N fertilizer was only provided in coffee pulp (\textquestiondown 150 kg N ha-1 yr-1), coffee production was very low (0.75 t dry matter [DM] ha-1 yr-1). Incorporating a legume tree stratum (Erythrina poeppigiana) increased berry production to 3 t DM ha-1 yr-1 without significant changes in NO3 - leaching. Compared to the highly fertilized agroforestry system (250 kg N ha-1 y-1) previously described, NO3 - leaching in this organically managed agroforestry system was reduced at least by two fold. N2O emissions were always insignificant compared to the losses though NO3 - leaching. However these emissions were increased by high inputs of mineral N fertilizer and to a lesser extent by leguminous shade trees. Coffee producers should be encouraged to adopt environmentally sound N management, reducing N inputs and refining shade management based on a combination of leguminous and timber tree species. Implementing environmentally sound practices for coffee production in Costa Rica should help preserve the ecological image of the country while generating incomes to the farmers.

The inclusion of fast growing timber trees in these coffee plantations may increase total biomass and reduce nutrient leaching. Potential controls of N loss were measured in an unshaded coffee (Coffea arabica L.) plot and in an adjacent coffee plot shaded with the timber species Eucalyptus deglupta Blume (110treesha-1), established on an Acrisol that received 180kgNha-1 as ammonium-nitrate and 2,700mmyr-1 rainfall. Results of the one year study showed that these trees had little effect on the N budget although some N fluxes were modified. Soil N mineralization and nitrification rates in the 0\textendash 20cm soil layer were similar in both systems ({$\approx$}280kgNha-1yr-1). N export in coffee harvest (2002) was 34 and 25kgNha-1yr-1 in unshaded and shaded coffee, and N accumulation in permanent biomass and litter was 25 and 45kgNha-1yr-1, respectively. The losses in surface runoff ({$\approx$}0.8kg mineral N ha-1yr-1) and N2O emissions (1.9kgNha-1yr-1) were low in both cases. Lysimeters located at 60, 120, and 200cm depths in shaded coffee, detected average concentrations of 12.9, 6.1 and 1.2mg NO3--Nl-1, respectively. Drainage was slightly reduced in the coffee-timber plantation. NO3- leaching at 200cm depth was about 27{$\pm$}10 and 16{$\pm$}7kgNha-1yr-1 in unshaded and shaded coffee, respectively. In both plots, very low NO3- concentrations in soil solution at 200cm depth (and in groundwater) were apparently due to NO3- adsorption in the subsoil but the duration of this process is not presently known. In these conventional coffee plantations, fertilization and agroforestry practices must be refined to match plant needs and limit potential NO3- contamination of subsoil and shallow soil water.},

In a full-sun coffee plot, where N fertilizer was only provided in coffee pulp (150 kg N ha-1 yr-1), coffee berry production was very low (0.7 t dry matter [DM] ha-1 yr-1 during three years). Incorporating a legume tree stratum (Erythrina poeppigiana) increased berry production to 3 t DM ha-1 yr-1 for the same period without significant changes in NO3- leaching. Compared to the highly fertilized agroforestry system (250 kg N ha-1 yr-1), mean NO3- concentration in water drainage in this \textquestiondown organically\textquestiondown{} managed agroforestry system was reduced by three fold. N2O emissions were always insignificant compared to the losses though NO3- leaching. However these emissions were increased by high inputs of mineral N fertilizer and to a lesser extent by leguminous shade trees. Coffee producers should be encouraged to adopt environmentally sound N management, reducing N inputs and refining shade management based on a combination of leguminous and timber tree species.

Over the last 20 years, coffee farms and landscapes across the region have undergone rapid and profound biophysical changes in response to low coffee prices, changing climatic conditions, severe plant pathogen outbreaks, and other drivers. Although these biophysical transformations are pervasive and affect millions of rural livelihoods, there is limited information on the types, location, and extent of landscape changes and their socioeconomic and ecological consequences. Here we review the state of knowledge on the ongoing biophysical changes in coffee-growing regions, explore the potential socioeconomic and ecological impacts of these changes, and highlight key research gaps. We identify seven major land-use trends which are affecting the sustainability of coffee-growing regions across Latin America in different ways. These trends include (1) the widespread shift to disease-resistant cultivars, (2) the conventional intensification of coffee management with greater planting densities, greater use of agrochemicals and less shade, (3) the conversion of coffee to other agricultural land uses, (4) the introduction of Robusta coffee (               Coffea canephora               ) into areas not previously cultivated with coffee, (5) the expansion of coffee into forested areas, (6) the urbanization of coffee landscapes, and (7) the increase in the area of coffee produced under voluntary sustainability standards. Our review highlights the incomplete and scattered information on the drivers, patterns, and outcomes of biophysical changes in coffee landscapes, and lays out a detailed research agenda to address these research gaps and elucidate the effects of different landscape trajectories on rural livelihoods, biodiversity conservation, and other aspects of sustainable development. A better understanding of the drivers, patterns, and consequences of changes in coffee landscapes is vital for informing the design of policies, programs, and incentives for sustainable coffee production.},

Agroforestry practices may also promote mineral N fertilization and the use of N2-fixing legumes that favor the emission of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG) (N2O and CH4). The present study evaluates the net GHG balance in two adjacent coffee plantations, both highly fertilized (250 kg N ha-1 year-1): a monoculture (CM) and a culture shaded by the N2-fixing legume tree species Inga densiflora (CIn). C stocks, soil N2O emissions and CH4 uptakes were measured during the first cycle of both plantations. During a 3-year period (6\textendash 9 years after the establishment of the systems), soil C in the upper 10 cm remained constant in the CIn plantation (+0.09 {$\pm$} 0.58 Mg C ha-1 year-1) and decreased slightly but not significantly in the CM plantation (-0.43 {$\pm$} 0.53 Mg C ha-1 year-1). Aboveground carbon stocks in the coffee monoculture and the agroforestry system amounted to 9.8 {$\pm$} 0.4 and 25.2 {$\pm$} 0.6 Mg C ha-1, respectively, at 7 years after establishment. C storage rate in the phytomass was more than twice as large in the CIn compared to the CM system (4.6 {$\pm$} 0.1 and 2.0 {$\pm$} 0.1 Mg C ha-1 year-1, respectively). Annual soil N2O emissions were 1.3 times larger in the CIn than in the CM plantation (5.8 {$\pm$} 0.5 and 4.3 {$\pm$} 0.3 kg N-N2O ha-1 year-1, respectively). The net GHG balance at the soil scale calculated from the changes in soil C stocks and N2O emissions, expressed in CO2 equivalent, was negative in both coffee plantations indicating that the soil was a net source of GHG. Nevertheless this balance was in favor of the agroforestry system. The net GHG balance at the plantation scale, which includes additionally C storage in the phytomass, was positive and about 4 times larger in the CIn (14.59 {$\pm$} 2.20 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 year-1) than in the CM plantation (3.83 {$\pm$} 1.98 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 year-1). Thus converting the coffee monoculture to the coffee agroforestry plantation shaded by the N2-fixing tree species I. densiflora would increase net atmospheric GHG removals by 10.76 {$\pm$} 2.96 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 year-1 during the first cycle of 8\textendash 9 years.},

  abstract = {Worldwide chemical fertilizer use has increased by four times during the last 50 years. Conventional agricultural systems have a high nitrifying nature, resulting in a loss of nearly 70\% of overall nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs, an estimated economic loss of \$81 billion. Over application of fertilizer is rampant in tropical developing nations in Central America, where coffee is major crop. Agroforestry offers ecologically sustainable land management strategies that promote the provision of ecosystem services such as, protection of biodiversity, climate change mitigation, and water and soil regulation. When legume trees are incorporated as the shade tree in coffee production, direct inputs of nitrogen can occur. The specific objectives of this study were, (1) to quantify the effects of inorganic fertilizer and shade treatments on soil organic carbon (SOC), (2) measure and quantify the mineralization rates under inorganic fertilizer and shade treatments, (3) determine if the spatial abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) is affected by varying shade management, or by inorganic fertilizer treatment, and 4) measure the effects of inorganic fertilizer application on the transfer of biologically fixed N by Erythrina poeppigiana to Coffea arabica in agroforestry systems in the region. The field study was conducted in Aquiares, Costa Rica. Chemical fertilizer was applied between four treatments at the rate of 0, 110, 170, and 230 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and coupled with three shade treatments (no shade, managed shade, full shade) defined by the management strategies of the legume tree E. poeppigiana. Analyses showed no significant difference in total SOC by fertilizer and shade treatments. Measured NH4+ \textmu mol/L NH4+ and NO2- + NO3- \textmu mol/L NO3- concentrations differed significantly by the shade treatment, but net nitrogen mineralization rates were not significantly different by fertilizer or shade treatment. A significant difference in dsDNA copy number of AOB per soil g-1 was determined by shade treatment. Finally, fertilizer treatment demonstrated a significant effect on the potential for biologically fixed nitrogen from E. poeppigiana to be transferred to coffee planted in association. Coffee agroforestry systems with full shade E. poeppigiana legume trees offered additional inputs of nitrogen to mitigate the use of chemical fertilizers.},

  abstract = {While there have been many valuable individual studies of the effects of agroforestry on changes in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, this information has not yet been brought together to provide an overall assessment of the effects of agroforestry. We therefore compiled and analysed data from 109 earlier observations from 56 peer-reviewed publications of net rates of change of biomass and/or soil carbon (C) stocks in agroforestry systems, and from 26 data sets from 15 peer-reviewed publications of net changes in the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). We categorized agroforestry into two distinct types: tree-crop coexistence types where trees and agricultural crops are grown together (type 1) and tree-crop rotation type where trees and crops are grown alternately on the same piece of land (type 2). We primarily assessed the changes in C storage and net GHG emissions between agriculture and type 1 agroforestry. The data showed high variability in net C sequestration rates in both biomass and soils depending on the type of agroforestry, with reported C increments ranging from 0.3 to 7.7 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1 in biomass and 1.0 to 7.4 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1 in soils. On average, type 1 stands sequestered 3.8 \AE{} 1.3 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1 in above-ground biomass, with no evidence of changed rates for stands aged 5\textendash 25 years. All available studies exclusively reported increases in soil C stocks, with highest reported soil C sequestration rates of more than 8 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1 for the first year after agroforestry establishment. Averaged across all observations, soil C sequestration rates were about 2 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1 in youngest stands that gradually diminished with time since stand establishment. Overall, type 1 agroforestry stands (at an average age of 14 years) sequestered 7.2 \AE{} 2.8 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1, with biomass and soil C sequestration contributing about 70\% and 30\% of that increment, respectively. Soils under agroforestry also oxidised 1.6 \AE{} 1.0 kg CH4 ha\`A1 y\`A1 and emitted 7.7 \AE{} 3.3 kg N2O ha\`A1 y\`A1. Comparing agroforestry and adjacent agricultural lands, we found only minor differences in net CH4 and N2O emissions, with no clear overall direction of change. Overall, agroforestry was estimated to contribute to mitigating 27 \AE{} 14 t CO2 equivalents ha\`A1 y\`A1 at least for the first 14 years after establishment. It is suggested that future studies should consider strategic approaches for data acquisition that develop comprehensive approaches to quantify all components of the GHG balance, relate net GHG emissions with quantification of the yield of produce, and develop models to summarise the findings.},

  abstract = {Effective conservation of biodiversity in patches of (semi-) natural vegetation is dependent on an understanding of the influence of management as well as spatial and temporal factors. In southwestern Ethiopia coffee generally grown under a rather dense layer of indigenous trees (so called semi-forest coffee - SFC) often in patches embedded in an open agricultural landscape. The aim of the study was to disentangle what governs the variation in species richness of woody species among such patches. We collected data on species and possible explanatory factors in 40 \texttimes{} 40 m plots centered in 40 SFC patches, measured the patch area for 1987 and 2013, and the amount of surrounding SFC-area for each patch. We recorded the number of coffee stems and the level of disturbance caused by slashing of the understory vegetation. Species richness of large coffee shade trees ({$>$}20 cm in diameter) was higher in larger patches with even slightly better fit of the statistical models when the historical area was taken into account. However, most species of large trees also occurred as seedlings showing that there is still a potential to conserve these species in the patches. Coffee management negatively affected the richness and density of woody species, especially in the intermediate size class (1.6\textendash 20 cm diameter). Disturbances accompanying coffee management such as slashing of the ground vegetation also negatively affected tree seedling density as well as species richness. There was no effect of connectivity on species richness. Based on the combination of these results we conclude that small patches of semiforest coffee had fewer species of large trees, not because of a lack of tree seedlings, but probably because of differentiated local extinctions, perhaps during the time when the species were intermediate sized. To maintain the species richness of large trees in semiforest coffee patches, the sites need to be actively managed.},

Under RCP 8.5, most coffee areas become of marginal and moderate suitability. The findings show that the continuity of coffee cultivation in a large portion of coffee areas in Central America is under threat and that farmers and policy-makers should develop adaptation portfolios for their farms and regions in a timely manner.},

  abstract = {Coffee (Coffea arabica L.) production is important for its economic, ecological and social values in tropical areas. Whether coffee is grown under shade (SHD) or full sunlight (SUN), may have a direct impact on soil nitrogen (N) cycling, which can affect yield and agroecosystem sustainability. We studied N cycling in coffee farms in three municipalities in Puerto Rico and evaluated three ecosystem types in each: SUN coffee, SHD coffee and secondary forest (FOR). Aboveground litter dry matter and litter N inputs were quantified. Litter dry matter inputs (t ha-1 year-1) were higher in SHD (2.15) and FOR (1.83), and were significantly greater than SUN (1.40). Litter N inputs (kg N ha-1 year-1) were significantly lower in SUN (31) than in SHD (52) and FOR (43). Cycling of N was evaluated in detail in the municipality of Las Marias in SHD and SUN coffee. Litter N inputs (kg N ha-1 year-1) to soil were significantly different between FOR (41) and SHD (56). The standing stock of N in aboveground biomass SHD was \textasciitilde 3 times that in SUN, and total N input was twice that in SUN. However, soil N standing stocks were similar in SHD and SUN, indicating faster litter N turnover in SUN than in SHD ecosystems. By contrast, net soil N mineralization rates (kg N ha-1 year-1) were \textasciitilde 2 times higher in SHD (96) than in SUN (49), indicating that soil N turnover is greater in SHD than SUN. Our results suggest that litter N is mineralized at a slower rate in SHD than in SUN, whereas soil N is mineralized at a slower rate in SUN than in SHD. Higher inputs of N to soil, and soil N turnover in SHD may result in improved coffee production and associated forest biomass N uptake. Higher soil N mineralization rates in SHD coffee suggest improved ecosystem sustainability than in SUN coffee, presumably due to higher microbial activity, greater microbial diversity and substrate availability.},

Proper shading is claimed to be one of the most promising practices to seek sustainability and better adapt coffee cultivation to climate change in marginal areas. This study recorded and compared coffee cherry yields over a ten-year period from shaded coffee (N-fixing-trees and timber trees) agroforestry systems under different management regimes (conventional vs. organic) in a suboptimal site. Significant differences in production were detected between conventional inputs vs. combination of organic inputs and shade types in some years of the evaluation period. Full-sun cultivation under intensive management was the most productive system for coffee yields, followed by shaded systems under timber trees. Interestingly, and regardless of management systems (intensive conventional or intensive organic) the worst combinations in terms of coffee yield were shaded systems under leguminous species (Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd. + Simarouba glauca DC.). Across all experimental plots, the timber species Simarouba glauca and Tabebuia rosea (Bertol.) DC. grew well, reaching a mean annual increment in diameter of 2.5-3.3 cm/year (age 12 years). Average gross revenues were higher in full-sun and timber-shaded agroforestry systems. Overall, intensive management regimes were the most expensive cultivation system to run but also the best in terms of coffee yield performance.},

  abstract = {Understanding how species functional traits relate to the delivery of ecosystem services is essential to support on-going biodiversity conservation efforts. While much recent work has been conducted, relatively few studies relating functional ecology to ecosystem services has utilized field experiments, particularly for animal species. We used a functional diversity (FD) approach to study the effect of bird traits on the control of the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and the effect of canopy cover management on bird FD. We conducted an exclosure experiment to test the effect of bird FD on the difference of H. hampei infestation rates between coffee shrubs both exposed to, and excluded from bird foraging activity. We addressed the following questions: (1) is avian FD, at the plot level, a good predictor of H. hampei infestation? (2) do gleaner bird species contribute to the control of the pest? and (3) how does shade management affect avian FD? We found that (1) all four FD indices calculated using bird traits were significant predictors of H. hampei differences in infestation rates, (2) richness of gleaning bird species was also a significant predictor of differences in H. hampei infestation rates, and (3) the interaction between month and canopy cover management affects bird FD, however whether this affects delivery of the pest control service remains unclear due to the particular biology of H. hampei. In revealing the connection between avian traits and the removal and potential control of H. hampei, our study highlights the importance of bird diversity persisting in agricultural landscapes, and the necessity of integrating bird conservation to foster healthy production systems.},

  abstract = {In spite of the large number of studies conducted on the drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, there is still no consensus on the impact of tillage on the distribution and turnover rate of SOC in the soil profile. Few studies have characterized precisely the turnover of SOC using 13C natural tracing or simulated the SOC evolution per soil layer. In this study, we combined several approaches (diachronic analysis of SOC stocks, isotopic tracing and modelling) for characterizing the SOC evolution per soil layer in one of the oldest tillage experiments comparing no-till (NT), shallow till (ST) and full inversion tillage (FIT) combined with six crop managements. The new measurements made in 2017 reported in this paper confirm that i) tillage had no effect on SOC stocks integrated over the old ploughed layer ({$\sim$}0-28 cm) or deeper ({$\sim$}0-58 cm) and ii) reduced tillage affected the SOC distribution in the soil profile, with SOC storage in the upper layer ({$\sim$}0-10 cm) offset by a SOC loss in the underlying layer ({$\sim$}10-28 cm). The change in rotation (from C4 to C3 crops) in two crop management treatments allowed to quantify the decrease in C4 stocks during 19 years and calculate the specific mineralization rates relative to tillage treatments and soil layers. The mineralization rates did not vary significantly between tillage treatments in the whole (old) ploughed layer ({$\sim$}0-28 cm) but varied according to depth and tillage. The highest rates were found in the layer 0-5 cm of NT or ST and the lowest rates in the layer 10-28 cm of the same tillage treatments. The rates were highly correlated with estimated C inputs and particulate organic matter contents in each layer, but not with tillage intensity. The evolution of total SOC and C4 stocks of each soil layer was simulated with AMG model during 47 years. The standard model (with a single mineralization rate) gave a good prediction of SOC evolution when applied to the whole profile ({$\sim$}0-28 cm) but not for each individual layer. Including a relationship between C input and mineralization rate in the model allowed to well simulate the SOC evolution in all soil layers. This study shows that the main effect of a change in tillage on SOC storage is the change in the distribution of C input throughout the profile and the corresponding variation of the priming effect rather than the change in physical soil disturbance.},

However, these age-old traditional home gardens are evolving rapidly in response to changes in both the socio-economic and biophysical environment. Altered cropping patterns, farm size and component interactions may affect the systems' sustainability. Home gardens exhibit a huge diversity in farms and farming systems, which needs to be understood in order to design interventions for improvement. Dynamics of home gardens were studied over two-decades (1991\textendash 2013) based on a survey of 240 farm households and focus group discussions. Farms were grouped into five types: Khat-based, Enset-cereal-vegetable, Enset-based, Enset-coffee and Enset-livestock. Farm trajectories revealed a shift from food-oriented Enset-based and Enset-livestock systems to (1) cash crop oriented khat-based systems, and (2) combined food and cash crop oriented Enset-cereal-vegetable systems. In densely populated, market proximate areas a major trend was expansion of khat, from 6 to 35\% of the area share per farm, while the combined area share of enset and coffee decreased from 45 to 25\%. Concurrently, the cattle herd size fell from 5.8 TLU to 3.9 TLU per household. In medium populated, less accessible areas the trend was consolidation of combined production of food and cash crops. Enset and coffee together maintained a share of over 45\%. Easy transport and marketing of the perishable cash-generating khat compared with traditional crops favoured its cultivation among smallholders located close to markets. The insights in home garden change in response to increasing population pressure, decreasing farm size and market development may help to design interventions to increase system sustainability.},

  abstract = {In Central America, coffee is mainly grown in agroforestry systems. This practice modifies the microclimate, which, in turn, influences coffee growth and development. However, modeling these microclimate modifications is a challenge when trying to predict the development of a disease in the understory crop, based on variables usually monitored in weather stations exposed to full sunlight. Furthermore, critical variables for plant disease development, such as leaf wetness duration and leaf temperatures, are generally not measured by weather stations. In our study, we sought to build models explaining daily minimum and maximum coffee leaf temperatures, daily coffee leaf wetness duration, and minimum and maximum air temperatures in agroforestry systems with a single shade tree species, which are common in Central America, and which were characterized by shade tree height, canopy openness and light gap distribution. The modeled variables were mainly explained by one or more meteorological variables provided by reference weather stations exposed to full sunlight. The presence of shade trees resulted in a buffer effect, reducing daily maximum air and leaf temperatures, and increasing daily minimum air and leaf temperatures. Moreover, except for the daily minimum air temperature under shade, shade tree characteristics affected these microclimatic variables. Indeed, the buffer effect on the daily maximum air temperature increased with shade trees 7 m tall or over, whereas for extreme leaf temperatures, this effect seemed to be further intensified by a dense and homogeneous canopy. The tallest shade trees also tended to provide conditions that reduced coffee leaf wetness duration. The coffee leaf stratum affected the daily maximum leaf temperature, with a top layer intercepting radiation for the lower strata, but had no effect on the daily minimum leaf temperature, detected at night. The models developed were simple equations allowing interpretation of shade tree height, the effects of canopy characteristics on the microclimate and were therefore useful for designing and managing agroforestry system. The more accurate models could be incorporated into an early warning system for coffee pests and diseases in the region.},

In an on-farm study, we used a variety of plant, soil and water- related variables to assess the effect of Erythrina spp. and Musa spp. on the provision of ecosystem services in productive, high-quality Coffea arabica plantations in Costa Rica. We found 1) no significant effect of shade trees on coffee production overall; 2) evidence that shade trees do affect flowering and subsequent cherry development, with effects strongly dependent on climate and annual variations in coffee plant physiology; 3) Erythrina shade trees significantly increased soil litter and relative infiltration rate of water in the soil, both linked to soil conservation and decrease in erosion; 4) even in highly fertilized environments, Erythrina trees do fix N which was taken up by adjacent coffee plants. The lack of significant negative effect of shade trees on overall coffee yield and the observation of the provision of other useful services was not unexpected, because of 1) the low density of shade trees in the study site (100\textendash 350 trees/ha pruned twice a year on average) and 2) the sensitivity of coffee yields to other interacting effects such as climate, pests and diseases and physiological variations in the plant. Pending further long-term research into the factors affecting coffee yield, we find shade trees provide sufficient ecosystem services to justify their integration in even intensively managed plantations.},

This review considers recent literature on the manifestation of these services in CAFS around the world to provide an overview of scientific knowledge. Crown structures of associated trees can facilitate optimum light conditions for cacao growth, and provide water through vertical root segregation. Leaf litter fall and roots from associated species contribute to nutrient cycling. Both nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing species can provide nutrients to the cacao plant, though competition from certain species may limit phosphorus and potassium uptake. Pest and disease regulating services can arise through careful shade management to create a microclimate which reduces susceptibility of cacao to fungal diseases and sun-loving pests. All CAFS store carbon to varying degrees; those resembling original forest much more than simple two-species systems from which shade trees are removed after maturity of the cacao stand. CAFS also promotes biodiversity conservation depending on structure, management, and landscape arrangement, though not to the extent of natural forests. Research opportunities to increase provision of these services include optimal spatial arrangement for nutrient cycling and functional diversity as well as landscape connectivity for biodiversity conservation. Trade-offs between carbon storage, biodiversity, cacao yield and socio-economic resilience are presented, indicating that optimization of ecosystem services in CAFS requires consideration of interactions between all services, including socio-cultural and economic ones.},

  abstract = {In agricultural production systems with shade trees, such as coffee, the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production intensification can be compensated for, or even outweighed, by the increase in carbon sequestration into above-ground and below-ground tree biomass. We use data from a long-term coffee agroforestry experiment in Costa Rica to evaluate the trade-offs between intensification, profitability and net greenhouse gas emissions through two scenarios. First, by assessing the GHG emissions associated with conversion from shaded to more profitable full-sun (un-shaded) systems, we calculate the break-even carbon price which would need to be paid to offset the opportunity cost of not converting. The price per tCO2e of emissions reduction required to compensate for the coffee production revenue foregone varies widely from 9.3 to 196.3 US\$ amongst different shaded systems. Second, as an alternative to intensification, production area can be extended onto currently forested land. We estimate this land-use change required to compensate for the shortfall in profitability from retaining lower intensity coffee production systems. For four of the five shade types tested, this land-use change causes additional GHG emissions {$>$}5 tCO2e ha\`A1 yr\`A1 resulting in net emissions {$>$}8 tCO2e ha\`A1 yr\`A1 for the whole system. We conclude that instead, by intensifying production, mechanisms similar to REDD that are based on reducing emissions through avoided land-use change (REAL) could play a major role in increasing the climate change mitigation success of agroforestry systems at the same time as aiding REDD through reducing pressure for further forest conversion to agriculture.},

  abstract = {Current carbon accounting methodologies often assume interactions between above-ground and belowground carbon, without considering effects of land management. We used data from two long-term coffee agroforestry experiments in Costa Rica and Nicaragua to assess the effect on total soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of (i) organic versus conventional management, (ii) higher versus moderate agronomic inputs, (iii) tree shade types. During the first nine years of coffee establishment total 0\textendash 40 cm depth SOC stocks decreased by 12.4\% in Costa Rica and 0.13\% in Nicaragua. Change in SOC differed consistently amongst soil layers: at 0\textendash 10 cm SOC stocks increased by 2.14 and 1.26 Mg C ha-1 in Costa Rica and Nicaragua respectively; however much greater reduction occurred at 20\textendash 40 cm (9.65 and 2.85 Mg C ha-1 respectively). Organic management caused a greater increase in 0\textendash 10 cm SOC but did not influence its reduction at depth. Effects of shade type were smaller, though heavily pruned legume shade trees produced a greater increase in 0\textendash 10 cm SOC than unpruned timber trees. No significant differences in SOC stocks were found between shaded and unshaded systems at any depth and SOC was poorly correlated with above-ground biomass stocks highlighting poor validity of ``expansion factors'' currently used to estimate SOC. SOC stock changes were significantly negatively correlated with initial SOC stock per plot, providing evidence that during establishment of these woody-plant-dominated agricultural systems SOC stocks tend to converge towards a new equilibrium as a function of the change in the quantity and distribution of organic inputs. Therefore it cannot be assumed that tree-based agricultural systems necessarily lead to increases in soil C stocks. While high inputs of organic fertiliser/tree pruning mulch increased surface-layer SOC stocks, this did not affect stocks in deeper soil, where decreases generally exceeded any gains in surface soil. Therefore site- and system-specific sampling is essential to draw meaningful conclusions for climate change mitigation strategies.},

The purpose of this study is to develop a robust, rigorous and replicable methodology that is flexible to data limitations and spatially prioritizes the vulnerability of agriculture and rural livelihoods to climate change. We have applied the methodology in Vietnam, Uganda and Nicaragua, three contrasting developing countries that are particularly threatened by climate change. We conceptualize vulnerability to climate change following the widely adopted combination of sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity. We used Ecocrop and Maxent ecological models under a high emission climate scenario to assess the sensitivity of the main food security and cash crops to climate change. Using a participatory approach, we identified exposure to natural hazards and the main indicators of adaptive capacity, which were modelled and analysed using geographic information systems. We finally combined the components of vulnerability using equal-weighting to produce a crop specific vulnerability index and a final accumulative score. We have mapped the hotspots of climate change vulnerability and identified the underlying driving indicators. For example, in Vietnam we found the Mekong delta to be one of the vulnerable regions due to a decline in the climatic suitability of rice and maize, combined with high exposure to flooding, sea level rise and drought. However, the region is marked by a relatively high adaptive capacity due to developed infrastructure and comparatively high levels of education. The approach and information derived from the study informs public climate change policies and actions, as vulnerability assessments are the bases of any National Adaptation Plans (NAP), National Determined Contributions (NDC) and for accessing climate finance.},

  abstract = {A promising option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils is the inclusion of cover crops in cropping systems. The advantage of cover crops as compared to other management practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) is that they neither cause a decline in yields, like extensification, nor carbon losses in other systems, like organic manure applications may do. However, the effect of cover crop green manuring on SOC stocks is widely overlooked. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to derive a carbon response function describing SOC stock changes as a function of time. Data from 139 plots at 37 different sites were compiled. In total, the cover crop treatments had a significantly higher SOC stock than the reference croplands. The time since introduction of cover crops in crop rotations was linearly correlated with SOC stock change (R2 = 0.19) with an annual change rate of 0.32 \AE{} 0.08 Mg ha\`A1 yr\`A1 in a mean soil depth of 22 cm and during the observed period of up to 54 years. Elevation above sea level of the plot and sampling depth could be used as explanatory variables to improve the model fit. Assuming that the observed linear SOC accumulation would not proceed indefinitely, we modeled the average SOC stock change with the carbon turnover model RothC. The predicted new steady state was reached after 155 years of cover crop cultivation with a total mean SOC stock accumulation of 16.7 \AE{} 1.5 Mg ha\`A1 for a soil depth of 22 cm. Thus, the C input driven SOC sequestration with the introduction of cover crops proved to be highly efficient. We estimated a potential global SOC sequestration of 0.12 \AE{} 0.03 Pg C yr\`A1, which would compensate for 8\% of the direct annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, altered N2O emissions and albedo due to cover crop cultivation have not been taken into account here. Data on those processes, which are most likely species-specific, would be needed for reliable greenhouse gas budgets.},

  abstract = {The response of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) agronomical performance to changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) is uncertain. Improving our understanding of potential responses of the coffee plant to these changes while taking into consideration agricultural management is required for identifying best-bet adaptation strategies. A mechanistic crop modelling approach enables the inclusion of a wide range of prior knowledge and an evaluation of assumptions. We adapt a model by connecting it to spatially variable soil and climate data, by which we are able to calculate yield of rain-fed coffee on a daily time-step. The model takes account of variation in microclimate and water use as influenced by shade trees. The approach is exemplified at two East African sites with distinctly different climates (Mt. Elgon, Uganda, and Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania) using a global sensitivity analysis for evaluation of model behavior and prior parameter uncertainty assessment. We use the climate scenario driven by the Hadley Global Environment Model 2-Earth System representative for the year 2050 to discuss potential responses of the coffee plant to interactions of elevated [CO2], temperature, and water availability. We subsequently explore the potential for adaptation to this scenario through shade management. The results indicate that under current climatic conditions optimal shade cover at low elevations (1000 m.a.s.l.) is 50\%, provided soil water storage capacity is sufficient, enabling a 13.5\% increase in coffee yield compared to unshaded systems. Coffee plants are expected to be severely impacted (ranging from 18\% to 32\% coffee yield reductions) at low elevations by increased temperature (+2.5 \textdegree C) and drought stress when no elevated [CO2] is assumed. Water competition between coffee and shade trees are projected to be a severe limitation in the future, requiring careful selection of appropriate shade tree species or the adoption of other technologies like conservation measures or irrigation. The [CO2]-fertilization effect could potentially mitigate the negative effect of temperature increase and drought stress up to 13\textendash 21\% depending on site conditions and will increase yield at higher altitudes. High uncertainty remains regarding impacts of climate change on flowering. The presented model allows for estimating the optimal shade level along environmental gradients now and in the future. Overall, it shows that shade proves to be an important adaptation strategy, but this requires improved understanding regarding site-specific management and selection of tree species. Moreover, we do not yet include climate change uncertainty.},

Our research aims to investigate the link between coffee producers' decisions and outcomes for biodiversity, using epiphytes as our focal group. Using qualitative methods, we interviewed 33 producers in northern Nicaragua to understand how they connect trees and epiphytes on their farms to ecosystem services and how personal values, access to agronomic expertise, labor supply, and financial stability influence decision-making. We used interview responses to construct six producer typologies. Most producers had strong positive attitudes toward trees and associated them with a variety of important ecosystem services. Smallholders were more likely to connect trees with provisioning services, while producers on larger farms and with greater agronomic knowledge emphasized regulating services. Most producers connected epiphytes primarily with aesthetic values. Across demographics, producers emphasized the restorative potential for shade coffee in repairing damage to soil, water, and nutrient cycles caused by other forms of agriculture. The conservation significance and sustainability of this social-ecological system can be maintained and expanded through economic and capacity-building conservation interventions, especially when those can be connected to values already held by farmers.},

The cropping system studied within our collaborative observatory (Coffee-Flux) corresponds to a coffee-based agroforestry system (AFS) under the shade of large trees of Erythrina poeppigiana (16\,\% of canopy cover). A lot of ES and disservices depend on local soil properties (here Andisols), especially erosion/infiltration, water/carbon and nutrient storage capacity. Therefore, for ES assessment, the type of soil is crucial. An adequate density of shade trees (rather low here) reduced the severity of leaf diseases with the prospect of reducing pesticide-fungicide use. A simple inventory of the basal area at collar of the coffee plants allowed estimating the belowground biomass and the average age of the plantation, to judge of its market value and to decide when to replace it. Coffee farms are probably much closer to C neutrality than predicted by the current C-Neutral protocol, which only considers shade trees. More comprehensive assessments, including trees, coffee, litter, soil, and roots in the C balance of the AFS are proposed. Shade trees offer many ES if they are adequately managed in the local context. As compared to full sun conditions, shade trees may (i) reduce laminar erosion by a factor of 2, (ii) increase N2 fixation and the \% of N recycled into the system, thus reducing fertilizer requirements, (iii) reduce the severity of leaf diseases, (iv) increase C sequestration, (v) improve the microclimate, and (vi) substantially reduce the effects of climate change. In our case study, no negative effect on coffee yield was found.},

  abstract = {Cereal straw, which is most often returned to the soil in arable cropping systems, is of renewed interest as a potential source of bioenergy. However, the sustainability of this practice which implies systematic removal of aerial biomass of cereal crops is a controversial issue, particularly in soils having a low soil organic carbon (SOC) content. This study aims at evaluating a simple model (AMG) to predict the consequences of straw export on SOC evolution in various cropping and pedoclimatic conditions. The model was tested on nine long-term field experiments (18\textendash 35 yr) dominated by cereal crops and differing in climate, soil type and carbon inputs. The model was able to provide satisfactory simulations of the evolution of SOC in most experiments with a unique set of parameters. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the quality of fit was very sensitive to humification coefficient, moderately sensitive to the size of the stable SOC pool and weakly affected by the ratio of belowground: aerial C input. The dependence of model parameters (humification and mineralization rates) on pedoclimatic conditions (soil clay content and temperature) was analyzed and compared to those proposed in other models (DAISY, CENTURY, ROTHC, CN-SIM) since they vary widely between models. AMG functions provided the best fit in seven out of nine experiments. More generally, the best fit was obtained by assuming that clay content had a small or no effect on humification coefficient and a marked effect on mineralization rate, in accordance with incubation studies in literature. The AMG model was used to simulate the impact of a straw export scenario in nine experiments considering a systematic straw removal one year out of two. With this scenario, straw removal vs. incorporation would reduce carbon stocks by 2.5\textendash 10.9\% of the initial SOC after 50 yr, depending primarily on the experiment (soil, climate, productivity) and secondarily on the size of the stable C pool (varying from 10\% to 65\%).},

In this paper, we assess soil nutrient availability and food web structure on a 17-year old experimental coffee plantation in Turrialba in Costa Rica. Three shade types (unshaded coffee, shaded with Terminalia amazonia, and shaded with Erythrina poepiggiana) combined with two management practices (organic and conventional) were evaluated. Total C and N, inorganic N and Olsen P content, soil pH, global soil fertility, and nematode and microarthropod communities were measured in the top 10 cm soil layer, with the objective of determining how shade tree species impact the soil food web and soil C, N and P cycling under different types of management.},

We examine a long-term experiment (15 years) established in Costa Rica in 2000 and compare intensive conventional (IC) coffee production under full sun with 19 agroforestry systems combining timber and service tree species with contrasting characteristics, with conventional and organic managements of different intensities. We assessed productivity through coffee yield and coffee morphological characteristics. IC had the highest productivity but had the highest yield bienniality; in the agroforestry systems productivity was similar for moderate conventional (MC) and intensive organic (IO) treatments (yield 5.3 vs. 5.0 t ha-1 year-1). Significantly lower yields were observed under shade than full sun, but coffee morphology was similar. Low input organic production (LO) declined to zero under the shade of the non-legume timber tree Terminalia amazonia but when legume tree species were chosen (Erythrina poepiggiana, Chloroleucon eurycyclum) LO coffee yield was not significantly different than for IO. For the first 6 years, coffee yield was higher under the shade of timber trees (Chloroleucon and Terminalia), while in the subsequent 7 years, Erythrina systems were more productive; presumably this is due to lower shade covers. If IC full sun plantations are not affordable or desired in the future, organic production is an interesting alternative with similar productivity to MC management and in LO systems incorporation of legume tree species is shown to be essential.},

However, contradicting reports on the effects of shade trees in coffee agroforestry systems are emanating from Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) farmers. Therefore, this study: (1) characterized the shade trees in Arabica coffee-based agroforestry system; (2) identified the tree selection criteria used; (3) identified the sources of planting materials; and (4) determined the major factors affecting the growing of shade trees under the Arabica coffee-based system of Mount Elgon. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in randomly selected coffee farms with and without shade trees. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 107 coffee farmers. Fourteen shade tree species were recorded, and the six most abundant were: Albizia coriaria, Cordia africana, Ficus ovata, Ficus synchromonous, Maesopsis eminii and Grevillea robusta. Least abundant species were Eucalyptus species, Antiaris toxicaria, Artocarpous heterophylus, Mangifera indica and Milicia excelsa. Farmers selected shade trees which were fast growing, had small leaf sizes, with wide crowns, ever-green and of medium height. Fellow farmers were the main source of shade-tree planting materials (P\,{$\leq$}\,0.05). Barriers to shade tree use included resource competition and falling trees damaging the understorey. The results underscore the need for site-specific provision of appropriate shade tree coffee mixes and strategies by policy and development partners for transformation of shaded coffee farming landscapes and livelihoods for improved coffee production.},

The objective of this study was to compare the performance of both techniques using data representing the main Brazilian soils. First, we derived PTFs for the parameters of van Genuchten equation and for water contents at Ϫ6, Ϫ10, Ϫ33, Ϫ100, and Ϫ1500 kPa for the same development data set. Second, we compared the performance of both techniques for the same validation data set. The approach, based on the estimation of water contents at specific water potentials, provided better results: for the validation data set, this technique showed an average root mean squared error of 0.036 m3 mϪ3, compared with an averaged error of 0.098 m3 mϪ3 of the technique based on the direct estimation of van Genuchten parameters. A possible explanation for this result might be related to the fact that soil moisture is controlled by different independent variables at different ranges of soil water potential, and those differences are not directly related to the van Genuchten parameters.},

  abstract = {Analysis of the economic and environmental outcomes of agricultural systems requires a bottom-up linkage from the farm to market, as well as a top-down linkage from market to farm. This study develops this two-way linkage between the Tradeoff Analysis Model of agricultural systems and a partial equilibrium market model. The resulting model can determine the effects of technology and policy interventions on the spatial distribution of environmental and economic outcomes at market equilibrium quantities and prices. The approach is demonstrated with a case study of tradeoffs between poverty and nutrient depletion in a semi-subsistence agricultural system (Machakos, Kenya). The results suggest that the linkage of market equilibrium analysis to farm level Integrated Assessment Models can be important in the analysis of agriculture\textendash environment interactions.},

  abstract = {Shade-grown, montane coffee agroforestry systems have the potential to conserve native tree species of conservation concern (CC) and typical of old growth or late succession (LS) forests in montane cloud forests. However, it remains unclear how preferential selection by farmers for or against certain tree species and diameter sizes affects CC and LS trees distribution and abundance. To address this issue, we investigated how management practices may inadvertently compromise the potential of agroforestry systems to serve as reservoirs for CC and LS trees. We sampled tree diversity in 31 coffee farms and 10 forest sites in La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico and assessed the relative importance of shade tree density, basal area, proportion of Inga spp. trees, previous land use, and age of fallow (for farms established on land with an agricultural history) on the proportions of CC and LS trees. We then examined if tree size distributions differed between farms and forests, and whether land use legacies mediated the impact of the explanatory variables of interest. These analyses found that management practices that sought to increase the proportion of Inga spp. trees had the largest negative impact on the proportions of trees of LS and CC, but the magnitude of the effects were dependent on land-use legacy. We also found that tree size distributions differed between farms and forests among smaller trees (5\textendash 20 cm diameter at breast height, (DBH)), but not among larger trees ({$>$}30 cm DBH). These findings suggest that in order to increase the conservation potential of coffee agroforestry systems, particularly for farms established on land with an agricultural history, it is important to promote farmers' tolerance of tree species other than Inga spp. and preferred tree species.},

  abstract = {This book describes how Bayesian methods work. Its primary aim is to demystify them, and to show readers: Bayesian thinking isn't difficult and can be used in virtually every kind of research. In addition to revealing the underlying simplicity of statistical methods, the book explains how to parameterise and compare models while accounting for uncertainties in data, model parameters and model structures. How exactly should data be used in modelling? The literature offers a bewildering variety of techniques and approaches (Bayesian calibration, data assimilation, Kalman filtering, model-data fusion, etc). This book provides a short and easy guide to all of these and more. It was written from a unifying Bayesian perspective, which reveals how the multitude of techniques and approaches are in fact all related to one another. Basic notions from probability theory are introduced. Executable code examples are included to enhance the book's practical use for scientific modellers, and all code is available online as well.},

Several plot-scale ecosystem services are simulated by the model, such as production, canopy cooling effect, or potential C sequestration. DynACof uses metamodels derived from a detailed 3D process-based model (MAESPA) to account for complex spatial effects, while running fast. It also includes a coffee flower bud and fruit cohort module to better distribute fruit carbon demand over the year, a key feature to obtain a realistic competition between sinks.{$<$}br{$>$} We compared the model outputs with a highly comprehensive database on a coffee agroforestry farm in Costa Rica. The fluxes simulated by the model were close to the measurements over a 5-year period (RMSE= 1.60 gC m-2 d-1 for gross primary productivity; 0.63 mm d-1 for actual evapo-transpiration, 1.34 MJ m-2 d-1 for sensible heat flux and 1.88 MJ m-2 d-1 for net radiation), and DynACof satisfactorily simulated the yield, NPP, mortality and carbon stock for each coffee organ type over a 35-year rotation.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion is a serious threat for cultivated soils on steep slopes under tropical conditions. In Costa Rica, coffee plantations are widespread on such steep slopes in several basins used for hydroelectric generation, which are affected by soil erosion and sedimentation in dam reservoirs. For this study, surface runoff and soil loss rate were measured during three years on large experimental plots installed within a coffee field on a steep slope (60\% average). The time interval for rainfall and runoff measurements was 5 min. A simple infiltration model presented by Diskin and Nazimov (1995) was used to estimate runoff during a rainfall event showing the relevance of initial soil water content in order to estimate runoff base on rainfall intensity variations. Three complementary embedded time scales were analyzed: annual\textendash monthly, event and intra-event. The rainy seasons included 581 rainfall events giving a total depth of 2206, 1778 and 2220 mm in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. Total runoff was 103 {$\pm$} 55, 54 {$\pm$} 14 and 33 {$\pm$} 6.4 mm in 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. Annual average sediment concentration was about 1.3 {$\pm$} 0.3 g l\`A1 with reduced temporal variations between years or rainfall events. The total soil loss was 1686 {$\pm$} 784, 914 {$\pm$} 306 and 575 {$\pm$} 140 kg ha\`A1 for 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively. Around 60\% of rainfall and 90\% of runoff and soil loss respectively came from the August\textendash October period and more than half of it from October. Total rainfall event and soil water content explained most of surface runoff and soil loss dynamics at three time scales analyzed. Inherited soil water storage from previous year played an important role on the relationship between rainfall and runoff dynamics the following year. Soil and coffee coverage did not have a significant effect on runoff and soil loss variability due to permanently good soil coverage (even in the rainy season). This good coverage over the rainy season prevented crust development. The presence of old micro-terraces helped to reduce runoff and sediment loss. The Diskin and Nazimov model demonstrated that a combination of rainfall intensity and soil water content dynamics on an intra-event scale explained better the differences observed in runoff and soil loss on an interevent scale. Runoff at intra event scale had high and low runoff moments depending on rainfall intensity and superficial soil layer water status and saturation of deeper layers under long rainfall events.},
