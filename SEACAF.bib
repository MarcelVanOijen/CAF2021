  abstract = {There is an increasing demand for information about the economic impact of agricultural carbon (C) sequestration in the developing world, but as yet no studies have assessed the potential for farmers in the highland tropics to participate in C contracts. In this paper we show how an econometric-process simulation model, designed to simulate the value of terrace and agroforestry investments, can be used to assess the economic feasibility of C sequestration. We use this model to simulate the impact of C contracts on the adoption of terraces and agroforestry practices in the highlands of northern Peru. The analysis shows that participation in C contracts could increase adoption of terraces and agroforestry practices, with the rate of adoption depending on the C accumulation rate and key factors affecting terrace productivity such as field slope. The simulation results show there is a relatively low economic potential for C sequestration in this agricultural system at C prices below \$50 per MgC, but that potential increases substantially for C prices above \$50 per MgC. Under favorable conditions for C sequestration and a C price of \$100 per MgC, terrace and agroforesty adoption and C sequestration have the potential to raise per capita incomes by up to 15\% on farms with steeply sloped fields, and reduce poverty by as much as 9\%.},

  abstract = {The Mesoamerican region is considered to be one of the areas in the world most vulnerable to climate change. We developed a framework for quantifying the vulnerability of the livelihoods of coffee growers in Mesoamerica at regional and local levels and identify adaptation strategies. Following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concepts, vulnerability was defined as the combination of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. To quantify exposure, changes in the climatic suitability for coffee and other crops were predicted through niche modelling based on historical climate data and locations of coffee growing areas from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. Future climate projections were generated from 19 Global Circulation Models. Focus groups were used to identify nine indicators of sensitivity and eleven indicators of adaptive capacity, which were evaluated through semi-structured interviews with 558 coffee producers. Exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were then condensed into an index of vulnerability, and adaptation strategies were identified in participatory workshops. Models predict that all target countries will experience a decrease in climatic suitability for growing Arabica coffee, with highest suitability loss for El Salvador and lowest loss for Mexico. High vulnerability resulted from loss in climatic suitability for coffee production and high sensitivity through variability of yields and out-migration of the work force. This was combined with low adaptation capacity as evidenced by poor post harvest infrastructure and in some cases poor access to credit and low levels of social organization. Nevertheless, the specific contributors to vulnerability varied strongly among countries, municipalities and families making general trends difficult to identify. Flexible strategies for adaption are therefore needed. Families need the support of government and institutions specialized in impacts of climate change and strengthening of farmer organizations to enable the adjustment of adaptation strategies to local needs and conditions.},

  abstract = {Production of coffee, especially by small holders, is often associated with various forms of shade management. To analyse the effects of shade on physical coffee quality and on sensorial cup quality of Coffea arabica L. cv. Caturra KMC, a study was carried out with 94 plots on 16 farms in two municipalities, Timana\textasciiacute{} and Oporapa, located at elevations from 1272 to 1730 masl. in Huila, Colombia. The study was designed with emphasis on shade cover variation within each of the two study areas, while minimizing the variability of environment, agronomic management other than shade, and post-harvest processing. 46 samples of shade coffee and 46 samples of sun coffee were evaluated for physical and sensorial attributes using three professional coffee cuppers (assessors). A principal component analysis including all quality and environmental variables showed that sensory attributes were influenced negatively by shade, and that physical attributes were influenced positively by altitude. A mixed linear model, with coffee cupper and farm as random variables, revealed different shade effects on coffee quality in the two areas. In Oporapa, situated at high altitudes, shade had a negative effect on fragrance, acidity, body, sweetness and preference of the beverage, while no effect was found on the physical quality. In Timana\textasciiacute{} , situated at lower altitudes, shade did not have a significant effect on sensorial attributes, but significantly reduced the number of small beans. At high altitudes with low temperatures and no nutrient or water deficits, shade trees may thus have a partly adverse effect on C. arabica cv. Caturra resulting in reduced sensory quality. The occurrence of berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) was lower at high altitudes and higher under shade. Future studies on shade and coffee quality should focus on the interaction between physical and chemical characteristics of beans.},

  abstract = {Agroforestry systems provide diverse ecosystem services that contribute to farmer livelihoods and the conservation of natural resources. Despite these known benefits, there is still limited understanding on how shade trees affect the provision of multiple ecosystem services at the same time and the potential trade-offs or synergies among them. To fill this knowledge gap, we quantified four major ecosystem services (regulation of pests and diseases; provisioning of agroforestry products; maintenance of soil fertility; and carbon sequestration) in 69 coffee agroecosystems belonging to smallholder farmers under a range of altitudes (as representative of environmental conditions) and management conditions, in the region of Turrialba, Costa Rica. We first analyzed the individual effects of altitude, types of shade and management intensity and their interactions on the provision of ecosystem services. In order to identify potential trade-offs and synergies, we then analyzed bivariate relationships between different ecosystem services, and between individual ecosystem services and plant biodiversity. We also explored which types of shade provided better levels of ecosystem services. The effectiveness of different types of shade in providing ecosystem services depended on their interactions with altitude and coffee management, with different ecosystem services responding differently to these factors. No trade-offs were found among the different ecosystem services studied or between ecosystem services and biodiversity, suggesting that it is possible to increase the provision of multiple ecosystem services at the same time. Overall, both low and highly diversified coffee agroforestry systems had better ability to provide ecosystem services than coffee monocultures in full sun. Based on our findings, we suggest that coffee agroforestry systems should be designed with diversified, productive shade canopies and managed with a medium intensity of cropping practices, with the aim of ensuring the continued provision of multiple ecosystem services. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Management practices are a key factor in the amount and quality of ecosystem services provided. There is relatively abundant information on ecosystem services provision within agroforestry systems, but comparatively scant information regarding how coffee farmers manage their plantations, the factors influencing their farming practices and the extent to which farmers' local knowledge \textendash{} as opposed to global scientific understanding \textendash{} underpins management decisions. Policymakers and scientists too frequently design development programs and projects in the coffee sector. On occasion technicians are included in the design process, but farmers and their knowledge are always excluded. This research explores farmers' knowledge regarding how trees affect coffee productivity and ecosystem services in Costa Rica. Farmers' knowledge on the effects of trees on coffee productivity was compared with that of other knowledge sources: coffee processors, technicians and scientists. Farmers were shown to have detailed knowledge regarding ecosystem services that their coffee agroforestry systems provide as well as on the interactions between trees and coffee productivity. When asked on the services that trees provide, farmers classified trees according to water protection, soil formation, or contribution to biodiversity conservation. These classifications were related to tree attributes such as leaf size, biomass production or root abundance. Comparison of coffee productivity knowledge from different knowledge sources revealed considerable complementarity and little contradiction.},

  abstract = {The assessment of crop yield losses is needed for the improvement of production systems that contribute to the incomes of rural families and food security worldwide. However, efforts to quantify yield losses and identify their causes are still limited, especially for perennial crops. Our objectives were to quantify primary yield losses (incurred in the current year of production) and secondary yield losses (resulting from negative impacts of the previous year) of coffee due to pests and diseases, and to identify the most important predictors of coffee yields and yield losses. We established an experimental coffee parcel with full-sun exposure that consisted of six treatments, which were defined as different sequences of pesticide applications. The trial lasted three years (2013\textendash 2015) and yield components, dead productive branches, and foliar pests and diseases were assessed as predictors of yield. First, we calculated yield losses by comparing actual yields of specific treatments with the estimated attainable yield obtained in plots which always had chemical protection. Second, we used structural equation modeling to identify the most important predictors. Results showed that pests and diseases led to high primary yield losses (26\%) and even higher secondary yield losses (38\%). We identified the fruiting nodes and the dead productive branches as the most important and useful predictors of yields and yield losses. These predictors could be added in existing mechanistic models of coffee, or can be used to develop new linear mixed models to estimate yield losses. Estimated yield losses can then be related to production factors to identify corrective actions that farmers can implement to reduce losses. The experimental and modeling approaches of this study could also be applied in other perennial crops to assess yield losses.},

  abstract = {Coffee is one of the most important tropical crops on earth, considering both its gross production value and the number of families that depend on it for their livelihoods. Coffee also grows within some of the world's most biodiverse habitats, in areas predicted to experience severe climate change impacts. Like many other crops, coffee benefits from several ecosystem services (ES) that provide important inputs or conditions for production. Given coffee's strong interactions with conservation, livelihoods, and climate change, it is important to understand the roles of biodiversity-regulated ES to coffee and how they are likely to change under future climates. Here we review the available literature on the provision of two essential and interacting ES that regulate coffee production: control of a beetle pest by birds and pollination by bees. Studies show that bird and bee communities provide pest control and pollination services that improve coffee quantity and quality, benefiting coffee farmers whose livelihoods depend on this crop. The literature also shows that a variety of plot, farm, and landscape management practices that support resources for bees and birds can enhance these ES. We also evaluate how these ES and their interactions may change under future climate change. Several studies have estimated likely climate impacts on coffee per se, but few have investigated climate vulnerability of pollination and pest control ES. Even less studies have quantified interactions between these ES. Although evidence is incomplete, managing coffee farms as diversified agroforestry systems could improve climate resilience of coffee cropping and communities of birds and bees, and therefore help farming families adapt to their changing environment. Based on our review, we identify six critical research priorities in this active area of study. Filling knowledge gaps would advance our understanding of interactions among landscapes, ES, and climate change, and would support climate adaptation for the millions of households whose livelihoods depend on coffee.},

Animals that consumed supplements and weeds at the coffee plantation had the highest daily weight gain (112.75 g). Analysis of the coffee farm considering the three existing groups (without sheep, with sheep without supplements and with sheep with supplements) presented a positive return rate, with the coffee-sheep-supplement being the best option in terms of economic, agricultural and environmental benefits as a whole, although the return rate was lower. It is concluded that the productive response of sheep obtained with a small amount of supplements (70 g/animal/day) while feeding on weeds was superior to that of animals grazing in pastures of established grasses, even when they received the same dose of supplements. Therefore it is suggested that keeping herds of sheep grazing on weeds in coffee plantations is economically profitable as well as agronomically and environmentally beneficial.},

One such a key ecosystem service, especially in the light of climate change mitigation, is carbon storage. Increasing human disturbance and management intensification, however, are known to affect the carbon storage potential of forests. Here we assessed how the above- and belowground carbon stocks in Ethiopian moist evergreen Afromontane forest co-varied with their biodiversity, and with increasing agroforestry management intensity for the production of Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica L.). We assessed above- and belowground carbon storage in 60 plots across a gradient of agricultural intensification ranging from natural forest, over two different coffee agroforestry systems, to intensified shade plantations. We quantified the diversity of ground beetles and woody plants in the same plots. Carbon stocks in natural forests (413 \AE{} 55.6 S.E. Mg ha\`A1) and in the most extensively managed agroforestry systems (387 \AE{} 50.0 Mg ha\`A1) were significantly higher than those in the more intensified agroforest system (258 \AE{} 39.4 Mg ha\`A1) and in shade plantations (219 \AE{} 22.8 Mg ha\`A1). Diversity of woody plants, but not of ground beetles, declined with increasing management intensity and decreasing carbon stocks. Overall, this study demonstrates that extensive coffee farming in Ethiopian moist Afromontane forests is able to deliver important co-benefits in terms of woody plant species conservation and carbon storage. Given the associated coffee yield cost, it is most likely, however, that supporting payments from certification or policy mechanisms such as REDD+ are required to keep these extensive coffee agroforestry systems economically viable, which is required to avoid management intensification and associated carbon and biodiversity losses.},

Deutsch et al. show that this effect may be exacerbated by insect pests (see the Perspective by Riegler). Insects already consume 5 to 20\% of major grain crops. The authors' models show that for the three most important grain crops\textemdash wheat, rice, and maize\textemdash yield lost to insects will increase by 10 to 25\% per degree Celsius of warming, hitting hardest in the temperate zone. These findings provide an estimate of further potential climate impacts on global food supply and a benchmark for future regional and field-specific studies of crop-pest-climate interactions. Science, this issue p. 916; see also p. 846 Insect pests substantially reduce yields of three staple grains\textemdash rice, maize, and wheat\textemdash but models assessing the agricultural impacts of global warming rarely consider crop losses to insects. We use established relationships between temperature and the population growth and metabolic rates of insects to estimate how and where climate warming will augment losses of rice, maize, and wheat to insects. Global yield losses of these grains are projected to increase by 10 to 25\% per degree of global mean surface warming. Crop losses will be most acute in areas where warming increases both population growth and metabolic rates of insects. These conditions are centered primarily in temperate regions, where most grain is produced. Models of insect population growth and metabolism in a warming climate predict losses of major food crops to insect pests.

We gathered data there in 2011 (dry season) on the presence/absence of CLR; coffee variety; age and density of coffee plants, and also took hemispherical photographs to determine canopy openness. In 2014 (wet season), we again gathered data on the same variables. In 2012, we collected soil samples from a subset of the plots. At all plantations, coffee variety had a significant effect on CLR incidence, with the Catimor variety infected less frequently than Caturra. Coffee plant age had a significant positive effect on CLR incidence. Increasing coffee density also increased CLR incidence for some of the studied plantations/seasons. Comparing those plots from which data were collected in the dry and wet seasons, we found that CLR presence was significantly higher in the wet season. The effect of shade on CLR incidence was not clear. Catimor and Caturra varieties showed opposite trends of CLR incidence in response to shade quantity in most cases (Caturra variety CLR incidence was decreasing with shading increase and Catimor CLR incidence decreasing with decreasing shading). Finally, the soil properties did not affect CLR incidence.},

In many developing countries, the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector is central to their NDCs. We generated a marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve for Vietnam's AFOLU sector and used it to review the country's mitigation pledges for this sector. We conclude that Vietnam could increase the emission pledges in its NDC, especially in future land use. Other options for mitigation at negative cost include water techniques in rice, agroforestry and management of livestock diets and manure. The MAC curve alone is insufficient to prioritize policy options for climate change policy, however, because it underestimates adaptation co-benefits, for example, in protected mangrove systems},

However, ecosystem services (ES) provided by companion trees in coffee agroforestry systems (AFS) can help farmers adapt to climate change. The objectives of this research were to develop agroforestry species recommendations and tailor these to the farmers' needs and local context, taking into consideration gender. Local knowledge of agroforestry species and ES preferences was collected through farmer interviews and rankings. Using the Bradley-Terry approach, analysis was done along an altitudinal gradient in order to study different climate change scenarios for coffee suitability. Farmers had different needs in terms of ES and tree species at different altitudes, e.g. at low altitude they need a relatively larger set of ES to sustain their coffee production and livelihood. Local knowledge is found to be gender blind as no differences were observed in the rankings of species and ES by men and women. Ranking species by ES and ranking ES by preference is a useful method to help scientists and extension agents to use local knowledge for the development of recommendations on companion trees in AFS for smallholder farmers.},

We analyzed the effects of landscape composition (amount of surrounding forest cover) and farm management (conventional vs. organic) on the diversity and structure of woody plant species assemblages in Costa Rican coffee agroforestry systems. We utilized information from a GIS land-use database, surveys of 1-ha plots located in 14 coffee farms and 4 forest fragments, and farmer interviews on management practices. The coffee farms harbored over 100 tree species, including 19\% of the native tree species found in the surrounding forests. The majority of tree species on the farms were native (82\%) to the study area and originated from natural regeneration (73\%). Among the tree species that regenerated naturally, 71\% were dispersed by animals. On the other hand more than half of the individuals were non-natives (55\%) and originated from planting, which resulted in low species similarity between farms and forests and a low density for most native species on the farms. Forest cover within a 1000 m radius around the farms varied between 4 and 38\%. Increasing forest cover around the farms had a significant, positive effect on species richness; especially on tree species dispersed by animals, and on species similarity between farms and forests. This suggests that the connection to natural forests increases seed dispersal into adjacent farms. The number of regenerated species was higher on the organic farms, but tree species richness was not affected by management type. Although species assemblages on the coffee farms are strongly determined by natural regeneration, the number of individuals contributed by these processes is low. Tree species conservation in agricultural landscapes would greatly benefit from protecting remnant forests, from facilitating natural regeneration processes and promoting native trees on farms, with particular attention to rare species.},

Research is needed on how to balance the competition from shade trees with the provision of ecological services to the coffee. In 2000, long-term coffee experiments were established in Costa Rica and Nicaragua to compare coffee agroecosystem performance under full sun, legume and non-legume shade types, and intensive and moderate conventional and organic inputs. Coffee yield from intensive organic production was not significantly different from intensive conventional in Nicaragua, but in Costa Rica it was lower during three of the six harvests. Full sun coffee production over 6~years was greater than shaded coffee in Costa Rica (61.8 vs. 44.7~t~ha-1, P~=~0.0002). In Nicaragua, full sun coffee production over 5~years (32.1~t~ha-1) was equal to coffee with shade that included Tabebuia rosea (Bertol.) DC., (27\textendash 30~t~ha-1) and both were more productive (P~=~0.03) than coffee shaded with Inga laurina (Sw.) Willd. (21.6~t~ha-1). Moderate input organic production was significantly lower than other managements under all shade types, except in the presence of Erythrina poepiggina (Walp.) O.F. Cook. Inga and Erythrina had greater basal area and nutrient recycling from prunings than other shade species. Intensive organic production increased soil pH and P, and had higher K compared to moderate conventional. Although legume shade trees potentially provide ecological services to associated coffee, this depends on management of the competition from those same trees.},

Agroforestry practices may also promote mineral N fertilization and the use of N2-fixing legumes that favor the emission of non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHG) (N2O and CH4). The present study evaluates the net GHG balance in two adjacent coffee plantations, both highly fertilized (250 kg N ha-1 year-1): a monoculture (CM) and a culture shaded by the N2-fixing legume tree species Inga densiflora (CIn). C stocks, soil N2O emissions and CH4 uptakes were measured during the first cycle of both plantations. During a 3-year period (6\textendash 9 years after the establishment of the systems), soil C in the upper 10 cm remained constant in the CIn plantation (+0.09 {$\pm$} 0.58 Mg C ha-1 year-1) and decreased slightly but not significantly in the CM plantation (-0.43 {$\pm$} 0.53 Mg C ha-1 year-1). Aboveground carbon stocks in the coffee monoculture and the agroforestry system amounted to 9.8 {$\pm$} 0.4 and 25.2 {$\pm$} 0.6 Mg C ha-1, respectively, at 7 years after establishment. C storage rate in the phytomass was more than twice as large in the CIn compared to the CM system (4.6 {$\pm$} 0.1 and 2.0 {$\pm$} 0.1 Mg C ha-1 year-1, respectively). Annual soil N2O emissions were 1.3 times larger in the CIn than in the CM plantation (5.8 {$\pm$} 0.5 and 4.3 {$\pm$} 0.3 kg N-N2O ha-1 year-1, respectively). The net GHG balance at the soil scale calculated from the changes in soil C stocks and N2O emissions, expressed in CO2 equivalent, was negative in both coffee plantations indicating that the soil was a net source of GHG. Nevertheless this balance was in favor of the agroforestry system. The net GHG balance at the plantation scale, which includes additionally C storage in the phytomass, was positive and about 4 times larger in the CIn (14.59 {$\pm$} 2.20 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 year-1) than in the CM plantation (3.83 {$\pm$} 1.98 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 year-1). Thus converting the coffee monoculture to the coffee agroforestry plantation shaded by the N2-fixing tree species I. densiflora would increase net atmospheric GHG removals by 10.76 {$\pm$} 2.96 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 year-1 during the first cycle of 8\textendash 9 years.},

  abstract = {While there have been many valuable individual studies of the effects of agroforestry on changes in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, this information has not yet been brought together to provide an overall assessment of the effects of agroforestry. We therefore compiled and analysed data from 109 earlier observations from 56 peer-reviewed publications of net rates of change of biomass and/or soil carbon (C) stocks in agroforestry systems, and from 26 data sets from 15 peer-reviewed publications of net changes in the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). We categorized agroforestry into two distinct types: tree-crop coexistence types where trees and agricultural crops are grown together (type 1) and tree-crop rotation type where trees and crops are grown alternately on the same piece of land (type 2). We primarily assessed the changes in C storage and net GHG emissions between agriculture and type 1 agroforestry. The data showed high variability in net C sequestration rates in both biomass and soils depending on the type of agroforestry, with reported C increments ranging from 0.3 to 7.7 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1 in biomass and 1.0 to 7.4 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1 in soils. On average, type 1 stands sequestered 3.8 \AE{} 1.3 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1 in above-ground biomass, with no evidence of changed rates for stands aged 5\textendash 25 years. All available studies exclusively reported increases in soil C stocks, with highest reported soil C sequestration rates of more than 8 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1 for the first year after agroforestry establishment. Averaged across all observations, soil C sequestration rates were about 2 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1 in youngest stands that gradually diminished with time since stand establishment. Overall, type 1 agroforestry stands (at an average age of 14 years) sequestered 7.2 \AE{} 2.8 t C ha\`A1 y\`A1, with biomass and soil C sequestration contributing about 70\% and 30\% of that increment, respectively. Soils under agroforestry also oxidised 1.6 \AE{} 1.0 kg CH4 ha\`A1 y\`A1 and emitted 7.7 \AE{} 3.3 kg N2O ha\`A1 y\`A1. Comparing agroforestry and adjacent agricultural lands, we found only minor differences in net CH4 and N2O emissions, with no clear overall direction of change. Overall, agroforestry was estimated to contribute to mitigating 27 \AE{} 14 t CO2 equivalents ha\`A1 y\`A1 at least for the first 14 years after establishment. It is suggested that future studies should consider strategic approaches for data acquisition that develop comprehensive approaches to quantify all components of the GHG balance, relate net GHG emissions with quantification of the yield of produce, and develop models to summarise the findings.},

In southwestern Ethiopia coffee generally grown under a rather dense layer of indigenous trees (so called semi-forest coffee - SFC) often in patches embedded in an open agricultural landscape. The aim of the study was to disentangle what governs the variation in species richness of woody species among such patches. We collected data on species and possible explanatory factors in 40 \texttimes{} 40 m plots centered in 40 SFC patches, measured the patch area for 1987 and 2013, and the amount of surrounding SFC-area for each patch. We recorded the number of coffee stems and the level of disturbance caused by slashing of the understory vegetation. Species richness of large coffee shade trees ({$>$}20 cm in diameter) was higher in larger patches with even slightly better fit of the statistical models when the historical area was taken into account. However, most species of large trees also occurred as seedlings showing that there is still a potential to conserve these species in the patches. Coffee management negatively affected the richness and density of woody species, especially in the intermediate size class (1.6\textendash 20 cm diameter). Disturbances accompanying coffee management such as slashing of the ground vegetation also negatively affected tree seedling density as well as species richness. There was no effect of connectivity on species richness. Based on the combination of these results we conclude that small patches of semiforest coffee had fewer species of large trees, not because of a lack of tree seedlings, but probably because of differentiated local extinctions, perhaps during the time when the species were intermediate sized. To maintain the species richness of large trees in semiforest coffee patches, the sites need to be actively managed.},

While much recent work has been conducted, relatively few studies relating functional ecology to ecosystem services has utilized field experiments, particularly for animal species. We used a functional diversity (FD) approach to study the effect of bird traits on the control of the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and the effect of canopy cover management on bird FD. We conducted an exclosure experiment to test the effect of bird FD on the difference of H. hampei infestation rates between coffee shrubs both exposed to, and excluded from bird foraging activity. We addressed the following questions: (1) is avian FD, at the plot level, a good predictor of H. hampei infestation? (2) do gleaner bird species contribute to the control of the pest? and (3) how does shade management affect avian FD? We found that (1) all four FD indices calculated using bird traits were significant predictors of H. hampei differences in infestation rates, (2) richness of gleaning bird species was also a significant predictor of differences in H. hampei infestation rates, and (3) the interaction between month and canopy cover management affects bird FD, however whether this affects delivery of the pest control service remains unclear due to the particular biology of H. hampei. In revealing the connection between avian traits and the removal and potential control of H. hampei, our study highlights the importance of bird diversity persisting in agricultural landscapes, and the necessity of integrating bird conservation to foster healthy production systems.},

  abstract = {Home gardens in southern Ethiopia are regarded as efficient farming systems, allowing interactions and synergies between crop, tree and livestock components. However, these age-old traditional home gardens are evolving rapidly in response to changes in both the socio-economic and biophysical environment. Altered cropping patterns, farm size and component interactions may affect the systems' sustainability. Home gardens exhibit a huge diversity in farms and farming systems, which needs to be understood in order to design interventions for improvement. Dynamics of home gardens were studied over two-decades (1991\textendash 2013) based on a survey of 240 farm households and focus group discussions. Farms were grouped into five types: Khat-based, Enset-cereal-vegetable, Enset-based, Enset-coffee and Enset-livestock. Farm trajectories revealed a shift from food-oriented Enset-based and Enset-livestock systems to (1) cash crop oriented khat-based systems, and (2) combined food and cash crop oriented Enset-cereal-vegetable systems. In densely populated, market proximate areas a major trend was expansion of khat, from 6 to 35\% of the area share per farm, while the combined area share of enset and coffee decreased from 45 to 25\%. Concurrently, the cattle herd size fell from 5.8 TLU to 3.9 TLU per household. In medium populated, less accessible areas the trend was consolidation of combined production of food and cash crops. Enset and coffee together maintained a share of over 45\%. Easy transport and marketing of the perishable cash-generating khat compared with traditional crops favoured its cultivation among smallholders located close to markets. The insights in home garden change in response to increasing population pressure, decreasing farm size and market development may help to design interventions to increase system sustainability.},

  abstract = {Intensively managed cropping systems with emphasis on productivity of the main crop can benefit from additional ecosystem services brought by integration of trees in the system - but potential drawbacks must also be accounted for. In an on-farm study, we used a variety of plant, soil and water- related variables to assess the effect of Erythrina spp. and Musa spp. on the provision of ecosystem services in productive, high-quality Coffea arabica plantations in Costa Rica. We found 1) no significant effect of shade trees on coffee production overall; 2) evidence that shade trees do affect flowering and subsequent cherry development, with effects strongly dependent on climate and annual variations in coffee plant physiology; 3) Erythrina shade trees significantly increased soil litter and relative infiltration rate of water in the soil, both linked to soil conservation and decrease in erosion; 4) even in highly fertilized environments, Erythrina trees do fix N which was taken up by adjacent coffee plants. The lack of significant negative effect of shade trees on overall coffee yield and the observation of the provision of other useful services was not unexpected, because of 1) the low density of shade trees in the study site (100\textendash 350 trees/ha pruned twice a year on average) and 2) the sensitivity of coffee yields to other interacting effects such as climate, pests and diseases and physiological variations in the plant. Pending further long-term research into the factors affecting coffee yield, we find shade trees provide sufficient ecosystem services to justify their integration in even intensively managed plantations.},

This review considers recent literature on the manifestation of these services in CAFS around the world to provide an overview of scientific knowledge. Crown structures of associated trees can facilitate optimum light conditions for cacao growth, and provide water through vertical root segregation. Leaf litter fall and roots from associated species contribute to nutrient cycling. Both nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing species can provide nutrients to the cacao plant, though competition from certain species may limit phosphorus and potassium uptake. Pest and disease regulating services can arise through careful shade management to create a microclimate which reduces susceptibility of cacao to fungal diseases and sun-loving pests. All CAFS store carbon to varying degrees; those resembling original forest much more than simple two-species systems from which shade trees are removed after maturity of the cacao stand. CAFS also promotes biodiversity conservation depending on structure, management, and landscape arrangement, though not to the extent of natural forests. Research opportunities to increase provision of these services include optimal spatial arrangement for nutrient cycling and functional diversity as well as landscape connectivity for biodiversity conservation. Trade-offs between carbon storage, biodiversity, cacao yield and socio-economic resilience are presented, indicating that optimization of ecosystem services in CAFS requires consideration of interactions between all services, including socio-cultural and economic ones.},

  abstract = {Current carbon accounting methodologies often assume interactions between above-ground and belowground carbon, without considering effects of land management. We used data from two long-term coffee agroforestry experiments in Costa Rica and Nicaragua to assess the effect on total soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of (i) organic versus conventional management, (ii) higher versus moderate agronomic inputs, (iii) tree shade types. During the first nine years of coffee establishment total 0\textendash 40 cm depth SOC stocks decreased by 12.4\% in Costa Rica and 0.13\% in Nicaragua. Change in SOC differed consistently amongst soil layers: at 0\textendash 10 cm SOC stocks increased by 2.14 and 1.26 Mg C ha-1 in Costa Rica and Nicaragua respectively; however much greater reduction occurred at 20\textendash 40 cm (9.65 and 2.85 Mg C ha-1 respectively). Organic management caused a greater increase in 0\textendash 10 cm SOC but did not influence its reduction at depth. Effects of shade type were smaller, though heavily pruned legume shade trees produced a greater increase in 0\textendash 10 cm SOC than unpruned timber trees. No significant differences in SOC stocks were found between shaded and unshaded systems at any depth and SOC was poorly correlated with above-ground biomass stocks highlighting poor validity of ``expansion factors'' currently used to estimate SOC. SOC stock changes were significantly negatively correlated with initial SOC stock per plot, providing evidence that during establishment of these woody-plant-dominated agricultural systems SOC stocks tend to converge towards a new equilibrium as a function of the change in the quantity and distribution of organic inputs. Therefore it cannot be assumed that tree-based agricultural systems necessarily lead to increases in soil C stocks. While high inputs of organic fertiliser/tree pruning mulch increased surface-layer SOC stocks, this did not affect stocks in deeper soil, where decreases generally exceeded any gains in surface soil. Therefore site- and system-specific sampling is essential to draw meaningful conclusions for climate change mitigation strategies.},

  abstract = {In agricultural production systems with shade trees, such as coffee, the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production intensification can be compensated for, or even outweighed, by the increase in carbon sequestration into above-ground and below-ground tree biomass. We use data from a long-term coffee agroforestry experiment in Costa Rica to evaluate the trade-offs between intensification, profitability and net greenhouse gas emissions through two scenarios. First, by assessing the GHG emissions associated with conversion from shaded to more profitable full-sun (un-shaded) systems, we calculate the break-even carbon price which would need to be paid to offset the opportunity cost of not converting. The price per tCO2e of emissions reduction required to compensate for the coffee production revenue foregone varies widely from 9.3 to 196.3 US\$ amongst different shaded systems. Second, as an alternative to intensification, production area can be extended onto currently forested land. We estimate this land-use change required to compensate for the shortfall in profitability from retaining lower intensity coffee production systems. For four of the five shade types tested, this land-use change causes additional GHG emissions {$>$}5 tCO2e ha\`A1 yr\`A1 resulting in net emissions {$>$}8 tCO2e ha\`A1 yr\`A1 for the whole system. We conclude that instead, by intensifying production, mechanisms similar to REDD that are based on reducing emissions through avoided land-use change (REAL) could play a major role in increasing the climate change mitigation success of agroforestry systems at the same time as aiding REDD through reducing pressure for further forest conversion to agriculture.},

  abstract = {As climate change continues to exert increasing pressure upon the livelihoods and agricultural sector of many developing and developed nations, a need exists to understand and prioritise at the sub national scale which areas and communities are most vulnerable. The purpose of this study is to develop a robust, rigorous and replicable methodology that is flexible to data limitations and spatially prioritizes the vulnerability of agriculture and rural livelihoods to climate change. We have applied the methodology in Vietnam, Uganda and Nicaragua, three contrasting developing countries that are particularly threatened by climate change. We conceptualize vulnerability to climate change following the widely adopted combination of sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity. We used Ecocrop and Maxent ecological models under a high emission climate scenario to assess the sensitivity of the main food security and cash crops to climate change. Using a participatory approach, we identified exposure to natural hazards and the main indicators of adaptive capacity, which were modelled and analysed using geographic information systems. We finally combined the components of vulnerability using equal-weighting to produce a crop specific vulnerability index and a final accumulative score. We have mapped the hotspots of climate change vulnerability and identified the underlying driving indicators. For example, in Vietnam we found the Mekong delta to be one of the vulnerable regions due to a decline in the climatic suitability of rice and maize, combined with high exposure to flooding, sea level rise and drought. However, the region is marked by a relatively high adaptive capacity due to developed infrastructure and comparatively high levels of education. The approach and information derived from the study informs public climate change policies and actions, as vulnerability assessments are the bases of any National Adaptation Plans (NAP), National Determined Contributions (NDC) and for accessing climate finance.},

The cropping system studied within our collaborative observatory (Coffee-Flux) corresponds to a coffee-based agroforestry system (AFS) under the shade of large trees of Erythrina poeppigiana (16\,\% of canopy cover). A lot of ES and disservices depend on local soil properties (here Andisols), especially erosion/infiltration, water/carbon and nutrient storage capacity. Therefore, for ES assessment, the type of soil is crucial. An adequate density of shade trees (rather low here) reduced the severity of leaf diseases with the prospect of reducing pesticide-fungicide use. A simple inventory of the basal area at collar of the coffee plants allowed estimating the belowground biomass and the average age of the plantation, to judge of its market value and to decide when to replace it. Coffee farms are probably much closer to C neutrality than predicted by the current C-Neutral protocol, which only considers shade trees. More comprehensive assessments, including trees, coffee, litter, soil, and roots in the C balance of the AFS are proposed. Shade trees offer many ES if they are adequately managed in the local context. As compared to full sun conditions, shade trees may (i) reduce laminar erosion by a factor of 2, (ii) increase N2 fixation and the \% of N recycled into the system, thus reducing fertilizer requirements, (iii) reduce the severity of leaf diseases, (iv) increase C sequestration, (v) improve the microclimate, and (vi) substantially reduce the effects of climate change. In our case study, no negative effect on coffee yield was found.},

We examine a long-term experiment (15 years) established in Costa Rica in 2000 and compare intensive conventional (IC) coffee production under full sun with 19 agroforestry systems combining timber and service tree species with contrasting characteristics, with conventional and organic managements of different intensities. We assessed productivity through coffee yield and coffee morphological characteristics. IC had the highest productivity but had the highest yield bienniality; in the agroforestry systems productivity was similar for moderate conventional (MC) and intensive organic (IO) treatments (yield 5.3 vs. 5.0 t ha-1 year-1). Significantly lower yields were observed under shade than full sun, but coffee morphology was similar. Low input organic production (LO) declined to zero under the shade of the non-legume timber tree Terminalia amazonia but when legume tree species were chosen (Erythrina poepiggiana, Chloroleucon eurycyclum) LO coffee yield was not significantly different than for IO. For the first 6 years, coffee yield was higher under the shade of timber trees (Chloroleucon and Terminalia), while in the subsequent 7 years, Erythrina systems were more productive; presumably this is due to lower shade covers. If IC full sun plantations are not affordable or desired in the future, organic production is an interesting alternative with similar productivity to MC management and in LO systems incorporation of legume tree species is shown to be essential.},

  abstract = {Analysis of the economic and environmental outcomes of agricultural systems requires a bottom-up linkage from the farm to market, as well as a top-down linkage from market to farm. This study develops this two-way linkage between the Tradeoff Analysis Model of agricultural systems and a partial equilibrium market model. The resulting model can determine the effects of technology and policy interventions on the spatial distribution of environmental and economic outcomes at market equilibrium quantities and prices. The approach is demonstrated with a case study of tradeoffs between poverty and nutrient depletion in a semi-subsistence agricultural system (Machakos, Kenya). The results suggest that the linkage of market equilibrium analysis to farm level Integrated Assessment Models can be important in the analysis of agriculture\textendash environment interactions.},

  abstract = {Shade-grown, montane coffee agroforestry systems have the potential to conserve native tree species of conservation concern (CC) and typical of old growth or late succession (LS) forests in montane cloud forests. However, it remains unclear how preferential selection by farmers for or against certain tree species and diameter sizes affects CC and LS trees distribution and abundance. To address this issue, we investigated how management practices may inadvertently compromise the potential of agroforestry systems to serve as reservoirs for CC and LS trees. We sampled tree diversity in 31 coffee farms and 10 forest sites in La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas, Mexico and assessed the relative importance of shade tree density, basal area, proportion of Inga spp. trees, previous land use, and age of fallow (for farms established on land with an agricultural history) on the proportions of CC and LS trees. We then examined if tree size distributions differed between farms and forests, and whether land use legacies mediated the impact of the explanatory variables of interest. These analyses found that management practices that sought to increase the proportion of Inga spp. trees had the largest negative impact on the proportions of trees of LS and CC, but the magnitude of the effects were dependent on land-use legacy. We also found that tree size distributions differed between farms and forests among smaller trees (5\textendash 20 cm diameter at breast height, (DBH)), but not among larger trees ({$>$}30 cm DBH). These findings suggest that in order to increase the conservation potential of coffee agroforestry systems, particularly for farms established on land with an agricultural history, it is important to promote farmers' tolerance of tree species other than Inga spp. and preferred tree species.},
