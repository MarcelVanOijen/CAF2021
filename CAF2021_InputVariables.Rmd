# Turrialba (Costa Rica): Long-term coffee agroforestry experiment

Two of the twenty treatments in this experiment had (and have) two upper-stratum timber tree species: Casha and Terminalia. Those treatments cannot be simulated with the current version of the model because the model can simulate at most one "upper" tree species (and at most two lower ones). So data for these two treatments were ignored.

## Weather

```

- We created a file with daily weather data 2000-2017 for five variables: radiation, temperature, atmospheric vapour pressure, wind speed, rainfall.
- For the period Jan 2000 - April 2014, we used a daily weather data file created by Oriana Ovalle.
- For the period May 2014 - May 2017, we used data downloaded from the CATIE website: daily data for rain, mostly monthly data for the other four variables.
- For the period June to Dec 2017, we used the median values of the same-day values from all preceding years.
- The wind speed data are clearly unreliable. There is evidence of sensor drift over time toward unrealistically low values.
- The absence of daily data for most variables May 2014-Dec 2016 is a problem.
- The absence of any data from June 2017 is a problem.
- Data from the weather station 73103 differed too much from CATIE data (in time periods and for variables where both had data) to be useful for gap-filling.

## Soil and management

- There was large spatial variation on the CATIE site, as we can see from very large differences between the three blocks of the experiment. We ignored this variation and used the same soil property values for all treatments.
- CAF2021 has simplistic equations for thinning and pruning, which may need to be improved sometime.
- For the fertilization levels of the AC and MC treatments, we used the values in the Ovalle model initialisation files (AC: 90+90+100 kg N ha-1 y-1; MC: 45+45+60 kg N ha-1 y-1). We assumed that the annual N-additions in the MO treatment were 20% of MC, and were zero in BO.
