  abstract = {Estimates of biomass in homegardens are primarily based on the tree component and few studies quantify the perennial herbaceous component. This component is of importance in the humid tropics of Mesoamerica, where distinct varieties and species of banana (Musa spp) are cultivated. This crop represents a dynamically stable biomass within homegardens and provides owners with continual production for alimentation and cash income. The aim of this study was to produce an allometric model for estimating the biomass of banana plants using dasonomic data, compare it to other models and estimate the biomass of cultivated banana plants from homegardens in the state of Tabasco, Mexico. This was based on the hypothesis that 1) the formulation of specific allometric models results in more precise estimations of the standing biomass of banana plants; and 2) banana plants contribute a significant proportion of the total biomass in homegardens. Dasonomic data and the dry weight of the above and below ground components of 30 individual plants of the most abundant species of banana (Musa balbisiana Colla) were collected in homegardens of the Los Rios region in Tabasco, Mexico. The mean biomass of the total plants of M. balbisiana harvested from homegardens was 5.85 kg plant-1, with a range of 0.52 \textendash{} 13.32 kg plant-1. The above-ground and corm biomass represent 87.6\% and 12.4\% of total biomass respectively. The above-ground biomass (AGB) was strongly correlated with pseudostem diameter (DBH) and to a lesser degree with height data. The Husch and Schumacher \textendash{} Hall models, with the variables pseudostem diameter at a height of 30cm (d30), height of the pseudostem (HF) and total height (HT), performed best statistically; however, based on the crossed validation, the best model was that proposed by Kopezky, with the equation AGB= -0.0927+0.0203*DBH2. In homegardens with banana plants, the banana biomass was between 0.1 and 1 t ha-1, and in some cases between 2 and 5 t ha-1. The mean density of the total biomass of the banana plants, in a sample of 69 homegardens where bananas were present, was 688 kg ha-1, corresponding to 2\% of above-ground biomass in the homegardens of the region of study.},

Using principal components analysis, a single variable was generated based on 57 variables, in order to determine an index explaining 87\%, 88\% and 90\% of the variability of soybean, coffee and banana crops, respectively, in municipal districts across Brazil. The climatic model was used to generate the zoning of the three plant diseases, using temperature and leaf wetness as input. Areas of favorability for the diseases were plotted against the main coffee, soybean and banana growing areas in Brazil. This methodology enabled the visualization of the changes in areas favorable for epidemics under possible future scenarios of climate change.},

Plantlets were generated in vitro on normal MS medium and later exposed to the nutrient concentrations for a total of 8 weeks. Thereafter, they were artificially inoculated with Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum using an insulin syringe. In each nutrient, plantlets exposed to higher nutrient concentrations significantly (P {$<$} 0.0001) accumulated more nutrient in their tissues compared with those exposed to lesser nutrient concentrations. Wilt incidences were significantly reduced, and incubation periods (time from inoculation to appearance of first disease symptoms) increased, with increasing nutrient application. The study lays a background for in vivo studies aimed at management of BXW using nutrients, such as fertilizer application.},

Farm workers were observed during daily production activities; 39 banana producers and 8 extension workers/researchers were interviewed; and a review of field experiments conducted by the National Banana Corporation between 1997 and 2002 was made. Correspondence analysis showed that there is no structured variation in large-scale banana producers' practices, but two other banana production systems were identified: a small-scale organic system and a small-scale conventional coffee\textendash banana intercropped system. Field-scale research may reveal ways that these practices can be scaled up to achieve a productive and profitable system producing high-quality export bananas with fewer or no pesticides.},

  abstract = {Prototyping methods are useful for designing alternative crop management systems (CMS), but they are usually considered mainly at the field level and are poorly equipped to take into account farm diversity in terms of economic, social and natural constraints. This may limit the likelihood of adoption of alternative CMS. This paper proposes a two-step methodological framework that takes into account the diversity of farms in the prototyping of new CMS. The first step of the framework is to design a farm typology that is able to characterise the diversity of current CMS in terms of their technical nature, farming context, and performance. We define a farming context as a set of characteristics at the farm level that are likely to influence the structure and the biophysical and economic performances of CMS at the field level. The typology is designed from a statistical analysis of a set of descriptive variables collected for a sample of farms. The second step of the framework uses this farm typology in a specific work agenda with a panel of experts in order to design a set of alternative CMS prototypes. Prototypes, and the objectives they are meant to reach, are designed by analysing current CMS performances and by mobilising agro-ecological knowledge to identify technical ways to improve them. The typological characterisation of farm diversity then makes it possible to define a set of constraints (SOC) for each farm type. Once the prototypes are designed, the experts use a compatibility indicator (CI) ranging from zero to one to measure the level of compatibility between each prototype and the SOC of each farm type. We define a prototype as compatible with a farm type if the prototype is not likely to increase the constraints of a farm of that type (CI=1). Using this indicator in a process of iterative improvement of prototype design makes it possible to define a set of a priori compatible prototypes for each farm type. The aim of this paper is to present our methodological framework and its application for prototyping new banana crop management systems in Guadeloupe. The six-class typology we developed corresponded to a great diversity of CMS with contrasting performances and farming contexts. The method led to the prototyping of 16 innovative CMS, involving different modalities of intercropping, patterns of pesticide use, choices of hybrid cultivars, and rotations with cover or cash crops. Finally, we discuss the limits of our methodological framework and its utility for improving prototyping approaches.},

  abstract = {The ex ante assessment of innovative agro-ecological innovations is a key step in the development of more sustainable crop management systems. To this end, models are useful tools because they make it possible to rapidly assess numerous innovations in different contexts. Whereas many farm optimisation models focusing on the farmer's strategic decision to adopt new crop management systems have been published, little attention has been given to the ex ante modelling of the dynamic operational impacts of innovation adoption at the farm level. BANAD, a mechanistic model for such applications, is proposed. It allows the ex ante assessment of innovative management systems including new agro-ecological techniques, while taking into account different farming contexts and policy and market conditions. It includes three components: (i) a crop management system model, (ii) a crop model (SIMBA) and (iii) a farming system model. Our results applied to the ex ante assessment of six innovative banana management systems for three contrasted farm types in Guadeloupe showed that the impacts of agro-ecological innovations, which include rotations, improved fallow, intercropping, pest-resistant cultivar, and an integrated organic system, can vary considerably according to (i) the farm type in which the innovation is integrated, (ii) the nature of the agro-ecological innovations, and (iii) the criteria considered and the temporal horizon of the assessment. Innovative intercropping systems that were effective at the field level in terms of the yield improvement and decreased pesticide use could be problematic at the farm level because they increased the workload and decreased income. The adoption of rotations or improved fallow seemed to be relevant for smallholders but could induce a critical period of 1.5\textendash 2.5years during which income decreased drastically. Under certain conditions of markets and subsidies, very environmentally friendly innovations that are less productive can however be economically effective.},

Agroecological innovations can help to reduce pesticide use and achieve cleaner and more sustainable banana production systems. Innovations must be well suited to the diversity of banana farms and acceptable to the stakeholders involved in production. We tested the impact of 18 agroecological innovations in Guadeloupe on the sustainability of three contrasted production systems, using the multi-criteria assessment model MASC. These innovations included different types of fallow (A), bans on pesticides (B), conditional applications of pesticides (C), intercropping (D), resistant cultivars (E), and integrated systems (F). In the assessment, we introduced the views of 29 stakeholders involved in sustainability issues relative to banana grouped through three sets of weightings, obtained by direct weighting of the indicators used in a multi-criteria assessment tool. We analysed the effects of each set of weightings on the sustainability level for these different banana production systems. Our results showed that the adoption of innovations can have negative, positive or no effects on the overall sustainability of banana production systems. Although none of the innovations had a positive effect on all cropping systems, some innovations were relevant to several farm types. However, this depended on the sets of weightings considered, because we found several types of stakeholder with opposing views on the importance of sustainability components. Integrated and organic systems produced the best results in terms of increasing sustainability and were relevant to current farming systems. However, in order to obtain cleaner banana production at the landscape scale, a combination of these innovations, tailored to the diversity of farmers' situations and stakeholder preferences, still needs to be proposed.},

  abstract = {To reduce chemical inputs while maintaining crop yield, disturbed ecosystem functions must be restored, for example by cover-crops. In these cropping systems, because of competition between species, soil resources must be carefully managed. Dedicated tools and models are needed that account for the adverse effects of the cover-crop on the cash crop in terms of resource availability. Besides classical agronomic calculations of stress indices, which are difficult to generalize and require numerous parameters, recent work in ecology has related plant traits, like the biomass accumulated, to the resource availability during the whole plant cycle. Following such a simple approach, the objectives of this study were (i) to determine the effects of water and nitrogen limitations on banana growth and development and to test whether simple integrated traits can highlight the effects of these stresses on banana growth, (ii) to parameterize a simple generic module of soil water and nitrogen availability linked to SIMBA GROW, the growth module of the banana crop model SIMBA, (iii) to assess the ability of the model to simulate banana growth and development in the environmental conditions of a banana/cover-crop system, with particular attention on the effects of changes in plot temperature on model outputs. Three experiments were conducted on whole production cycles to investigate the effects of different water regimes, different nitrogen fertilization levels, and the cover-crop Neonotonia wightii on banana growth, nutritional status, and date of flowering. Results showed low nitrogen availability affected banana growth only weakly but decreased leaf nitrogen content and delayed flowering. Low water availability delayed flowering and decreased banana growth. In both cases, the delayed flowering allowed longer banana growth, which balanced the negative effect of low availability on the growth rate. The cover-crop modified both the rooting depth of the banana, and thus the amount of resources accessible to the banana roots, and the plot microclimate, especially air temperature. The model correctly reproduced the differences of date of flowering and leaf area index at flowering for a first cycle of production between a bare-soil and a cover-crop system, provided air temperature was reduced by 2\textendash 3\% due to the cover-crop. To conclude, this study showed that in fairly constant environmental conditions (temperature, radiation and rainfall) a simplified model using resource availability over the growing period and integrated plant traits satisfactorily simulates banana growth in an intercropped system.},

Here, we characterized plant biomass partitioning, tissue nutrient distribution and carbohydrates status of banana seedlings grown under sufficient and deficient Mg supply. We also studied the potential of remedying Mg deficiency by foliar application of Mg. Mg deficiency severely decreased plant growth, especially biomass partitioning from rhizome to root and led to a reduction of root/shoot dry weight ratio. Under Mg deficiency, plant Mg status was reduced but the concentrations of N, P and K were increased in most tissues. Mg deficiency caused an overall reduction in tissue glucose and fructose contents, and accumulation of sucrose, amylose and amylopectin in leaves. Sucrose, amylose and amylopectin contents were however reduced in pseudostem, rhizome and root of plants with Mg deficiency. Foliar application of Mg to Mg-deficient plants completely recovered banana plant growth, nutrients and carbohydrates status.},

  abstract = {Within-bunch (inflorescence) variability in banana fruit weight is of great importance: distal fruits (at the bottom of the bunch) are 30 to 40\% smaller than basal fruits at the top. We hypothesize that this variability is related to a developmental lag between fruits. To validate this hypothesis, histological studies (evolution in number of cells along the fruit radius, starch granule number and size) associated with physiological measurements (pulp dry weight, dry matter and starch concentration) were carried out. Fruit development stages were dated in cumulative degree-days (dd) from flower emergence to 3 weeks after the harvest stage (1300dd). For a fruit located at the top of the bunch, cell divisions ceased around 350dd and cells began to fill with starch as soon as they appeared. A developmental lag between fruits at the top and bottom of the bunch was observed: cell divisions started and stopped approx. 70dd later in bottom (distal) compared to top (basal) fruits. At the end of cell divisions, basal fruits had a higher number of cells along the fruit radius. This difference in cell number may be due to increased competition for assimilates between fruits when cell division occurs in distal fruits. Variability in cell number may be related to variability in pulp dry weight. We conclude that within-bunch variability in banana fruit weight is related to a difference in cell number and age.},

  abstract = {Black leaf streak disease (BLSD), caused by the fungal pathogen Mycosphaerella fijiensis, is considered as the most destructive foliar disease of banana. To advance our knowledge of the dynamics of the disease at plant scale as well as of the components of varietal resistance, we designed, calibrated and evaluated a mechanistic model to simulate the disease on a banana plant. The model runs in discrete time at plant scale and describes plant growth and pathogen dynamics under optimal epidemiological conditions. The model is divided into two modules: a deterministic plant sub-model that simulates the simplified architecture and growth of the banana, and a pathogen sub-model that simulates the detailed life cycle of the pathogen including infection, lesion growth, asexual and sexual sporulation, and the dispersal of spores on the plant. The three most influential epidemiological parameters identified by sensitivity analysis of the model (lesion growth rate, infection efficiency, and incubation period) were estimated in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and acquired data on the dynamics of leaf lesions under natural conditions. The posterior densities provided precise knowledge on pathogen life history traits. The evaluation of the model using an independent data set confirmed the good quality of the predictions. Simulations allowed us to evaluate the impact of host resistance components, auto-infection at plant scale, and of the leaf emergence rate, which is linked with cropping practices, on the severity of BLSD. This foliar disease simulation model will help design new methods of controlling BLSD.},

  abstract = {Wild Musa species constitute an important component of tropical rain forests, wet evergreen forests and deciduous forests. Unlike forest trees, biomass estimation models are virtually lacking for wild Musa species. The present study aimed to determine whether growth and biomass accumulation in Musa species follow simple allometric scaling rules; and to develop allometric models for estimation of biomass storage in wild Musa balbisiana stands. A total of 156, M. balbisiana plants were harvested for above and below ground biomass for developing the biomass estimation models. The commonly used height-diameter (H-D) models: Chapman-Richard, exponential, Gompertz, hyperbolic, Michaelis-Menten (saturation growth), power-law, Weibull and Von Bertalanffy functions were used to predict missing heights from field measurement of plant diameter. The performance of the power-law model involving D alone, pseudo-stem height (Hp) alone or a combination of D and Hp was used to develop the best biomass estimation model. Nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression (NSUR) was used to model total biomass stocks. The stand density and basal area of the wild Musa stand was 14900 pseudo-stem ha-1, and 14.94~m2~ha-1, respectively. Based on the goodness of fit criteria, Hp, and D at 130~cm, the Exponential and Gompertz functions were observed to be the two best models for describing H-D relationship. A model containing D and Hp was found to be the best model for total biomass estimation in M. balbisiana. The total biomass stock predicted by our best NSUR model was 90.7~Mg~ha-1, of which 55.4~Mg~ha-1 was found in above-ground and 34.7~Mg~ha-1 in below-ground plant parts. The present study suggests wild M. balbisiana hold significant potential to contribute to stand level biomass stock in forest ecosystems where they occur mixed with trees.},

This is attributed mainly to the variety, type of planting material used, season and method of planting besides management techniques such as water and nutrients. Among all the commercial varieties of banana, owing to comparatively higher yield potential and better marketability both in domestic and export markets the Cavendish group of bananas such as Grand Naine, Williams, Robusta are preferred over other cultivars of banana. Planting sword suckers is beneficial and more ideal conventional planting material than the water suckers, butts and bits of rhizomes. However, the in-vitro banana plants of Dwarf Cavendish and Robusta are superior to conventional suckers due to their vigorous growth, early flowering (19 days) and reduced crop duration by 29 and 22 days, respectively. With reference to plant spacing and planting density which is determined by varieties grown, soil fertility status, prevailing climatic conditions etc. and maintenance of lower density of 625-1000 plants ha-1 recorded low productivity at {$<$}30t ha-1, while, high density of 5000 plants ha-1 recorded 120t ha-1. However, time taken for maturity was distinctly longer in higher densities, with 120 and 160 days Bunch grade and fruit quality are, however determined by pre-harvest bunch management practices. Influence of method of irrigation, fertilizer application and the role of nutrient elements, organic farming, INM and use of bunch sleeves on yield and fruit quality in different commercial cultivars under various conditions is discussed.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of plant density on growth and yield of dessert bananas in the humid tropics, but effects of plant densities in relations with ecological characteristics in low input East African highland banana (Musa spp., AAA-EA genome) cropping systems have not been reported. On-station field experiments were conducted in three contrasting agro-ecological sites of Rwanda (Kibungo low rainfall with medium soil fertility, Rubona high rainfall with low soil fertility and Ruhengeri high rainfall with high soil fertility) to explore germplasm\texttimes environment interactions. Five different plant densities (plantsha-1): 1428, 2500, 3333, 4444 and 5000 and two cooking (``Ingaju'', ``Injagi'') and one beer (``Intuntu'') cultivars were investigated. The effect of plant density on plant performance (growth and yield) over two cropping cycles in low input systems was determined. The effects of site\texttimes cultivar and site\texttimes density interactions on yield traits were significant (p{$<$}0.05). Annual yield increased with increasing plant density but strongly depended on agro-ecological site (from 6.1 to 9.2tha-1yr-1 at Kibungo, 9.5 to 21.5tha-1yr-1 at Rubona and 7.0 to 25.0tha-1yr-1 at Ruhengeri). Yields of beer cultivars increased with density, but those of cooking cultivars decreased. Maximum yields were attained at 4444plantsha-1 at Kibungo and Rubona whilst yields increased linearly beyond this level at Ruhengeri. Crop cycle duration was prolonged with increasing plant density. Relationships between bunch yield, the total above ground dry matter yields and soil chemical properties suggest that nutrient deficiencies were larger at Kibungo (e.g. K) and Rubona (e.g. K, P, Ca and Mg) compared with Ruhengeri, where yield correlated significantly with leaf area index (LAI). LAI increases up to 4, where 95\% of solar radiation was intercepted by the crop canopy, indicating that increasing the LAI above 4 would have little effect on production. Evaporation was much greater at lower rainfall areas (e.g. Kibungo) and accompanied by negative annual water deficit (-135mmyr-1) than at high rainfall areas (e.g. Ruhengeri) with positive water surplus (382mmyr-1). Growing degree days from planting to bunch harvest were higher at Kibungo (3675\textdegree C days) but much less at the Ruhengeri cooler site (1729\textdegree C days), implying temperature is not restrictive at Ruhengeri. This study showed that the optimal density for bananas depends on water availability, soil fertility and cultivar, which serves as an entry point to maximize yield potential for the East African smallholder farmers rather than using a uniform blanket recommended density. We suggest that agronomic optimal plant density is lower ({$<$}4444plantsha-1) in low rainfall ({$<$}1000mmyr-1) and less fertile areas but seem to be higher ({$>$}5000plantsha-1) in areas with high fertility which receive high rainfall ({$>$}1300mmyr-1).},

  abstract = {Highland bananas are an important staple food in East Africa, but there is little information on their physiology and growth patterns. This makes it difficult to identify opportunities for yield improvement. We studied allometric relationships by evaluating different phenological stages of highland banana growth for use in growth assessment, understanding banana crop physiology and yield prediction. Pared corms of uniform size (cv. Kisansa) were planted in a pest-free field in Kawanda (central Uganda), supplied with fertilizers and irrigated during dry periods. In addition, tissue-cultured plants (cv. Kisansa) were planted in an adjacent field and in Ntungamo (southwest Uganda), with various nutrient addition treatments (of N, P, K, Mg, S, Zn, B and Mo). Plant height, girth at base, number of functional leaves and phenological stages were monitored monthly. Destructive sampling allowed derivation of allometric relationships to describe leaf area and biomass distribution in plants throughout the growth cycle. Individual leaf area was estimated as LA (m2) = length (m) \texttimes{} maximum lamina width (m) \texttimes{} 0.68. Total plant leaf area (TLA) was estimated as the product of the measured middle leaf area (MLA) and the number of functional leaves. MLA was estimated as MLA (m2) = -0.404 + 0.381 height (m) + 0.411 girth (m). A light extinction coefficient (k = 0.7) was estimated from photosynthetically active radiation measurements in a 1.0 m grid over the entire day. The dominant dry matter (DM) sinks changed from leaves at 1118 \textdegree C days (47\% of DM) and 1518 \textdegree C days (46\% of DM), to the stem at 2125 \textdegree C days (43\% of DM) and 3383 \textdegree C days (58\% of DM), and finally to the bunch at harvest (4326 \textdegree C days) with 53\% of DM. The allometric relationship between above-ground biomass (AGB in kg DM) and girth (cm) during the vegetative phase followed a power function, AGB = 0.0001 (girth)2.35 (R2 = 0.99), but followed exponential functions at flowering, AGB = 0.325 e0.036(girth) (R2 = 0.79) and at harvest, AGB = 0.069 e0.068(girth) (R2 = 0.96). Girth at flowering was a good parameter for predicting yields with R2 = 0.7 (cv. Mbwazirume) and R2 = 0.57 (cv. Kisansa) obtained between actual and predicted bunch weights. This article shows that allometric relationship can be derived and used to assess biomass production and for developing banana growth models, which can help breeders and agronomists to further exploit the crop's potential.},

  abstract = {The Government of Nepal has identified opportunities in agricultural commercialization, responding to a growing internal demand and expansion of export markets to reduce the immense trade deficit. Several cash crops, including coffee and bananas, have been identified in the recently approved Agriculture Development Strategy. Both of these crops have encouraged smallholder farmers to convert their subsistence farming practices to more commercial cultivation. Identification of suitable agro-ecological zones and understanding climate-related issues are important for improved production and livelihoods of smallholder farmers. Here, the suitability of coffee and banana crops is analyzed for different agro-ecological zones represented by Global Environmental Stratification (GEnS). Future shifts in these suitability zones are also predicted. Plantation sites in Nepal were geo-referenced and used as input in species distribution modelling. The multi-model ensemble model suggests that climate change will reduce the suitable growing area for coffee by about 72\% across the selected emission scenarios from now to 2050. Impacts are low for banana growing, with a reduction in suitability by about 16\% by 2050. Bananas show a lot of potential for playing an important role in Nepal as a sustainable crop in the context of climate change, as this study indicates that the amount of area suited to banana growing will grow by 40\% by 2050. Based on our analysis we recommend possible new locations for coffee plantations and one method for mitigating climate change-related problems on existing plantations. These findings are expected to support planning and policy dialogue for mitigation and support better informed and scientifically based decision-making relating to these two crops.},

  abstract = {In banana cropping systems, cover crops are introduced mainly to manage weeds and mitigate the use of herbicides. But this introduction modifies the structure of the field, its biophysical functioning and then farmers' practices. We designed the SIMBA-IC model to simulate nitrogen and light partitioning and crop management, which can differ across the different zones of the field (banana row, small and large inter-rows), and to assess agronomic and environmental performances of banana cover cropping systems under scenarios of different spatial arrangement. We calibrated and validated the model using independent data sets from a fertilizer and an intercropping experiment, respectively. Results showed that SIMBA-IC realistically simulated the differences between treatments in terms of crop cycle duration (for flowering date, RMSE=2.3 weeks in the calibration and validation steps) and biomass produced (RMSE=0.67 and 0.94kgDMha-1 at flowering in calibration and validation steps, respectively). We simulated different management options related to the four field zones to optimize fertilization and cover crop management and ensure a tradeoff between agronomic (banana yield) and environmental (N leaching mitigation) performances. Simulations showed that yield was maximal and N leaching was reduced when fertilization was applied in the banana row. When cover crops were mowed according to the banana N stress, agronomic and environmental performances were higher than when mowing was based on the cover crop leaf area index, but the former approach led to very frequent mowing. Future studies should consider the impacts of these cropping systems from a socio-economic point of view to assess their feasibility and ability to be adopted.},

  abstract = {Bananas are often grown in mixed cropping systems. In Latin America, small growers cultivate bananas with minimal labor and purchased inputs in shaded coffee as a source of monthly income to supplement annual coffee sales. We deployed the framework of agroecological intensification in collaboration with six groups of small coffee growers in Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru to assess the potential to improve the productivity of banana in mixed systems. After a formal diagnostic study of 30 smallholder coffee farms in each site carried out by scientists, farmer experimentation groups in the same sites did their own diagnostic sampling and identified priority areas for experimentation. Scientists and farmers developed prototypes for system improvement, and alternative management approaches of system components, labor and inputs. Across pilot zones, `Gros Michel' was the most common cultivar, with banana mat density from 300 to 600 mats/ha with 950 to 1200 pseudostems/ha. Tree density varied from 150 to 550 trees/ha with available light ranging from 50 to 70\%, and from 35 to 45\% for banana and coffee. Farmer priorities across zones were similar: tree, banana and coffee resource partitioning; improved nutrition; coffee pruning; Fusarium wilt management; and marketing for better banana prices. Prototypes for testing addressed: light partitioning among trees, bananas and coffee; an input-output analysis of nutrients to increase the contribution of nitrogen from shade trees and reorient purchased nutrients; a shifting framework of Fusarium wilt management to address quarantine and cultivar substitution; and a marginal return analysis for step-wise intensification of the system, including banana.},

  abstract = {The largest abiotic constraint threatening banana (Musa spp.) production is water stress, impacting biomass buildup and yields; however, so far no studies have investigated the effects of water stress on allometric equations in banana. Weighted least square regression models were built for (i) estimating aboveground vegetative dry biomass (ABGVD) and corm dry biomass (cormD) and (ii) forecasting bunch fresh weight (bunchF), based on non-destructive parameters for two cultivars, Mchare Huti-Green Bell (HG, AA) and Cavendish Grande Naine (GN, AAA), under two irrigation regimes: full irrigation (FI) and rainfed (RF). FI affected growth, yield, and phenological parameters in the field (p {$<$} 0.05) depending on the onset of moisture stress. Pseudostem volume (Vpseudo) proved a good predictor for estimating ABGVD (R2adj = 0.88\textendash 0.92; RRMSE = 0.14\textendash 0.19), but suboptimal for cormD (R2adj = 0.90\textendash 0.89, RRMSE = 0.21\textendash 0.26 for HG; R2adj = 0.34\textendash 0.57, RRMSE = 0.38\textendash 0.43 for GN). Differences between RF and FI models (p {$<$} 0.05) were small as 95\%CI overlapped. Vpseudo at flowering predicted bunchF in FI plots correctly (R2adj = 0.70 for HG, R2adj = 0.43 for GN; RRMSE = 0.12\textendash 0.15 for HG and GN). Differences between FI and RF models were pronounced as 95\%CI did not overlap (p {$<$} 0.05). Bunch allometry was affected by irrigation, proving bunchF forecasting needs to include information on moisture stress during bunch filling or information on bunch parameters. Our allometric relationships can be used for rapid and non-destructive aboveground vegetative biomass (ABGVD) assessment over time and to forecast bunch potentials based on Vpseudo at flowering.},

  abstract = {Banana monocultures (Musa spp., AAA, Cavendish sub-group cv. Grande Naine) can have a detrimental impact on the environment. In these agro-systems, pesticide treatments can lead to surface and groundwater pollution, as is the case in the tropical insular conditions of the French West Indies. Using models to design alternative cropping systems is of growing interest but most of the research work has been concentrated on annual crops and most often in temperate climate. A specific model called SIMBA was built to assess environmental risks under a large range of cropping techniques and to help design more sustainable cropping systems. SIMBA simulates banana-cropping systems at field level over several cropping cycles. It includes sub-models that simulate soil structure, water balance, root nematode populations, yield, and economic outputs with a sound balance between representing the major phenomena well and keeping the model simple to reduce the parameterization costs in a large range of conditions. Agro-environmental indicators generated by the model make it possible to assess the major potential environmental impacts. The model has been developed and calibrated in Guadeloupe and Martinique and is used to draw up practical recommendations for farmers and for virtual experiments of agro-technological innovations or field management strategies. The structure of SIMBA is presented and a methodology is proposed for designing sustainable banana-based cropping systems using the model. SIMBA has been evaluated in a broad range of cropping systems in Guadeloupe by comparing model estimates to data collected in field experiments and surveys. Simulations lead to trends in rotation-based cropping systems characterized by systems that can be considered as intensive for profit evaluation, and combinations of frequent replanting, low nematicide application, no ploughing, and low fertilization level, for environmental evaluation. Simulations performed to optimize the replanting decision rule showed that relatively frequent replanting is good for profit while low frequency replantations (over four banana cycles) give a better environmental evaluation.},

The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of different doses of nitrogen on crop development during two production cycles in order to adjust fertilizer recommendations to values consistent with plant requirements. Sixth-generation banana Williams plants were subjected to five treatments of nitrogen doses at five stages of development and during two production cycles. Two linear models, according to the phenological stage and vegetative structures, were used, assessing the variables of dry weight and nitrogen content. The statistical differences found for the effect of the nitrogen dose on the dry matter accumulation per plant organ and nitrogen content in the plants for the development stages per production cycle and between the cycles allowed for the selection of the 321.8 and 483 kg ha-1 ha of nitrogen doses as the better ones. In this research, the nitrogen dose of 483 kg ha-1 was the most successful at obtaining the highest nitrogen content in the plants. This research confirmed the practical utility of nutrient extraction curves because they allowed for the selection of the fertilizer dose with the best response.},

A multivariate approach of the differences among cycles was used to adjust the models and eliminate their individual effect, with a randomized complete block design with repeated measurements over time. There were significant differences among plant development stages, with an increase in nutrient accumulation in the banana plant, there were no differences among treatments or blocks, nor in the interaction block by treatment, but the dose of 321.8 kg of N, exhibited a fructification increase in terms of N accumulation, harvest was exceeded by the dose of 483 kg of nitrogen, Ca and Mg, were the other nutrients, which showed effect at the dose of 483 kg of N but increasing only to harvest. It was concluded that high doses of nitrogen showed a trend to increase nutrient accumulation during the development of the banana plant, but especially until fructification, with the exception of Ca and Mg, which achieved the greatest accumulation in harvest.},

  abstract = {The bananas are thought to be particularly sensitive to changes in the environment. This review considers some historical and recent investigations into the response of the leaf, root and reproductive system to the environment. Monteith's analysis of the response of plants to intercepted radiation is appropriate for analyzing the productivity of bananas and plantains. The banana is sensitive to soil water deficits, and expanding tissues such as emerging leaves and growing fruit are among the first to be affected. As soil begins to dry, stomata close and leaves remain highly hydrated, probably through root pressure. Productivity is affected because of the early closure of stomata. We find the common belief that bananas use large amounts of water does not have a strong physiological basis. Improvements in water-use efficiency in irrigated plantations could come from a closer match between plant water use and the amount of water applied. We examine recent data on water-use efficiency of different banana cultivars and propose that agronomists, physiologists and breeders could quantify the amount of water available in each rain-fed environment and work towards directing more of that water through the plant. The banana is day neutral for floral induction, but photoperiods of less than 12 h are associated with a slowing in the rate of bunch initiation that is independent of temperature expressed as growing degree days. This may contribute to seasonal variations in banana flowering, even in more tropical environments with moderate temperatures.},

  abstract = {Coffee and banana are major cash and food crops, respectively, for many smallholders in the East African highlands. Uganda is the largest banana producer and 2nd largest coffee producer in Africa. Both crops are predominantly grown as monocultures. However, coffee\textendash banana intercropping is common in densely populated areas. This study assessed the profitability of intercropped coffee\textendash banana systems compared to mono-cropped systems in regions growing Arabica (Mt. Elgon) and Robusta (south and west) coffee in Uganda. The study was carried out in 152 plots in 2006/2007. Data were collected through structured farmer interviews, field measurements and observations. Coffee yields did not differ significantly (P{$\leqslant$}0.05) between mono-crops and intercrops. Arabica coffee yields were 1.23 and 1.18tha-1year-1 of green beans in mono-cropped and intercropped plots, respectively. Robusta yields averaged 1.25 and 1.09tha-1year-1 of green beans in mono-crops and intercrops, respectively. Banana yields were significantly higher (P{$\leqslant$}0.05) in intercrops (20.19tha-1year-1) compared with mono-crops (14.82tha-1year-1) in Arabica growing region. In Robusta growing region, banana yields were significantly lower (P{$\leqslant$}0.05) in intercrops (8.89tha-1year-1) compared with mono-crops (15.04tha-1year-1). Marginal rate of returns of adding banana to mono-cropped coffee was 911\% and 200\% in Arabica and Robusta growing regions, respectively. Fluctuations in coffee prices are not likely to affect the acceptability of intercrops when compared with coffee mono-crops in both regions, but an increase in wage rates by 100\% can make intercropping unacceptable in Robusta growing region. This study showed that coffee\textendash banana intercropping is much more beneficial than banana or coffee mono-cropping and that agricultural intensification of food and cash crops in African smallholder systems should not solely depend on the mono-crop pathway.},

  abstract = {The potential for bananas to produce year round is best expressed when water is abundant and daily temperatures are in the range of 20-30C. Zones with these conditions produce fruit for the global market. However, banana production, mainly for national markets, has developed in many subtropical areas under less than optimum conditions. Bananas are an important cash crop in southern Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, in countries of North Africa, the Middle East and southern Africa, and in China and northern India. In these regions, bananas are subject to sub-optimum temperatures and short days. Highly favorable temperatures and long days in the summer may also include short periods of extreme temperatures above 35C, while rainfall is also highly variable. The effects of climate change on selected subtropical production areas were modeled in a two-step procedure using the EcoCrop model, under current growing conditions and for 2020 and 2050 using a set of 19 IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) Global Climate Models (GCMs) under the SRES-A2 (business as usual) emission scenario. The modeling showed that current suitability for banana production in the subtropics is much lower than in the tropics with great variation in suitability within the subtropics. Of nine subtropical regions considered, two have improved conditions by 2020s, four are largely unaffected and three have a lower suitability. Our analysis also showed that, in terms of environmental conditions, certain sites are widely represented globally, offering options for technology transfer between sites. Other sites have few similar sites, which means that sites need to be carefully selected for approaches to technology development and transfer. The study leveraged site-specific information with widely available tools to understand potential effects of climate change in the subtropics. However, in order to fully understand the impacts of climate change on banana, the modeling tools used here need to be fully suited for semi-perennial crops to capture the effects of seasonal temperature and rainfall variability on crop cycle length and potential yields.},

  abstract = {The Haya people in northwest Tanzania have thrived by practising a unique farming system in which banana (Musa acuminata and M. balbisiana) is a staple food. Recent population pressure and long-term shortage of manure, however, have caused disputes about the decline in banana production. In this study, to begin to solve the issue, the biomass of banana plants grown in Haya fields on the Kamachumu Plateau was estimated by using a non-destructive method. Twelve quadrats of 100 or 225m2 were established. Pseudostem height and diameter of all banana plants in each quadrat were measured, and the pseudostem volume was calculated. The fresh weight (FW) and dry weight (DW) of each plant in the quadrats were calculated from the relationship between the pseudostem volume and FW and DW of various organs in 14 sampled plants. The total DW of banana plants in each unit field area varied greatly among quadrats (from 0.12 to 1.45kgm-2), but it averaged 0.92{$\pm$}0.08kgm-2 on a farm scale, which was reasonably homogeneous despite the differences in farm size of each household and fertility management. The annual production of banana bunches was estimated at 3.4kgm-2 from the average bunch FW and the annual bunch-bearing proportion: it was much higher than in the surrounding areas. Nevertheless, owing to a small proportion of edible part in a banana bunch, the current system would provide a net dry matter yield (pulp) of 0.38kgm-2 a year. This yield is comparable to a reasonably good yield (grains) of cereal crops in the tropics. However, the banana yield for each unit time should be at least halved because the plants need 1 year to produce the yield. The turnover rate of total dry matter was 0.7\textendash 0.9 a year, showing a dynamic exchange of photosynthates and nutrients in permanent banana fields. Further study is needed to strengthen the sustainability of the current farming system from wider perspectives, including the nutrient balance and socio-economic aspect.},

Our analysis showed that, due to its high productivity, non-cyclic agriculture is obligatory to support an ever-growing population and to offset the resultant continuous loss of arable land per person. Fertilizers to be applied should be quantified to exactly meet the balance between plant requirements and natural supply. Over-fertilization should always be avoided. Degradation of soils in the tropics is caused mainly by water and wind erosion, and to a lesser extent from nutrient disturbance (mainly from shortages). The environmental-protective effects of permanent crops are shown using two examples. One is in Erimo, Hokkaido, where fishermen have revived their local fisheries by reforesting the coastline, and the other in Tanzania where indigenous people thrive on the permanent culture of bananas. In the tropics, the use of vegetation as soil cover confers advantages in highly fragile areas, if only because of protection from erosion. The introduction of permanent crops is an alternative to establishing co-existence between agriculture and the environment.},
